        "reason": "The actual output gives a correct high-level summary and describes the roles of EVs, EVSE, the grid, and ISO 15118, but omits significant technical detail present in the expected output, such as EVCC and SECC roles, BCB, SLAC, explicit message types (e.g., SessionStopReq), state transitions (B1/B2), dedicated conformance tests, and detailed breakdown of physical/data-link layer protocols. No outright fact contradictions are present, but several architectural details and protocol mechanisms are missing."

        "reason": "The actual output correctly describes HPGP's role in smart grid and EV charging, mentions ISO 15118-3 compliance, SLAC, OFDM, ISP, and coexistence; but omits important physical layer details such as Control Pilot line specifics, band-notching, details of coupling mechanisms, MAC layer features (such as Control SAP, ETH SAP), exact messages used in SLAC and matching (e.g. CM_SLAC_MATCH, validation flows), and nuances about regulatory references and implementation considerations (like low-pass filters and prescalers). No factual contradictions are present but there is some loss of technical specificity."

However, important procedural details are omitted or not explicit: no mention of the CM_MNBC_SOUND_IND sounding process, CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR_IND, CM_SLAC_MATCH_REQ/CNF and CM_VALIDATE_REQ/CNF exchanges, the exact session initiation with precise timer names or the shutdown step. Test-related timer and conformance requirement references are missing. No direct contradictions but some procedural depth is lacking."

However, it omits explicit mention of the Central Communication Controller (CCo), specifics like TP_match_leave timing requirements, and precise triggers for joining/leaving (e.g., D-LINK_TERMINATE.request), which represent penalty-worthy omissions of detail."

However, it omits precise technical details found in the expected output: the CCo is always on the EVSE side, the EV must never assume the CCo role (V2G3-A06-02), and the specific configuration primitives (APCM_SET_CCo.REQ) and SLAC MMEs are not explicitly mentioned. There are no factual contradictions, but important implementation detail is missing."

        "reason": "The actual output does not contradict the expected output and accurately distinguishes that Data SAP is for user data transmission and Data Link Control SAP is for control and link management. However, it omits specific detail about the typical primitives/messages (such as DATA-LINK_SEND.REQ or D-LINK_READY.indication) mentioned in expected output and equates ETH SAP with Data SAP only briefly. The description is also somewhat more verbose and less precise about the separation of data-plane and control-plane functionality."

        "reason": "Actual Output generally matches Expected Output in not contradicting facts and describing both basic signaling and high-level communication within the context of EV charging and ISO 15118. However, it omits critical details: it does not mention that basic signaling is strictly analog/no data link, omits PLC (HomePlug Green PHY) for HLC, lacks important specifics such as Plug-and-Charge, explicit IEC 61851-1/Mode 3 references, details on session management, and certain fallback mechanisms. Some details are vaguely worded or generalized rather than specifying functional boundaries, causing loss of clarity and detail compared to the Expected Output."

However, it omits significant technical details found in the expected output, such as specific port mappings (pt_SLAC_Port, pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port), distinctions in how ports are used, the test hierarchy (creation/teardown of multiple PTCs), and detailed protocol flows and message types (CM_VALIDATE, SLAC, EIM status).

However, it omits specific details found in the Expected Output: explicit mention of hierarchical organization (modules/tests), detailed examples of identifier formats (e.g., TS_EVCC_SessionSetup), distinction of test case templates for EVCC/SECC, explicit reference to annexes (and D.4 utility functions by name), and specific references to PICS/PIXIT driving test selection and section numbers in the ISOs. No contradictory facts, but notable detail omissions reduce the score."

However, it omits detail on the specific types of EIM (e.g. RFID, apps), key ISO requirements and mandates (e.g., V2G3-M06-04, -08, V2G5-033/034), and the coordination with other processes like SLAC-based matching and early credential detection.

However, it omits specific details such as Application_Type and Security_Type fields, the required value/lengths, timing windows like TP_EV_SLAC_init and TT_EVSE_SLAC_init, and precise requirements for when and how the message is sent (e.g., after Control-Pilot state B). Some field-level details and required timer names/limits (e.g., TT_Matching_Repetition, maximum retries) are also missing. No factual contradictions are present, but the omissions of concrete and standard-mandated detail warrant a substantial penalty."

However, it omits several crucial details from the expected output, such as explicit roles of origin and destination (EV always sends, EVSE always receives), precise timing constraints (TT_match_sequence, TP_EV_batch_msg_interval, C_EV_START_ATTEN_CHAR_INDS), details about management message templates, specifics of response behavior and standards references, and exact references to test-case names.

It covers its optional use, handshake with CM_AMP_MAP.CNF, possible retransmissions with timeout and retry logic (TT_match_response, C_EV_match_retry), and the context of per-carrier power adjustment. However, there is some omission of important detail: it does not specify that AMDATA entries are 4 bits, each encoding 2 dB steps relative to \u221250\u2009dBm/Hz, nor the dual use cases (power reduction and host-to-host transfer) or acknowledgement of duplicate handling.

However, it omits critical protocol details: it doesn't specify explicitly that the message must follow HomePlug Green PHY's strict MME format or reference Table A.9, and slightly misrepresents reply timing (stating CNF is sent after the timer expiration instead of within it).
