However, it omits significant technical implementation details (e.g., physical signal coupling, OFDM specifics, Power/Data Link Layer protocols, network formation, precise commissioning steps, coexistence, EMC/ESD, and specific testing standards like IEC 61851-1 and V2G3-A11). While there are no direct factual contradictions, the heavy omission of protocol stack details, layer functions, transmission path considerations, signal injection methods, and detailed standard references results in a substantial loss of important content."
