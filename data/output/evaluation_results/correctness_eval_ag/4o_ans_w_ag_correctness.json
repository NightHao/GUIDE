        "reason": "The actual output correctly describes D-LINK_PAUSE.request as a protocol command in V2G communication for EV and EVSE, focusing on energy saving and maintaining link state. It references V2G3-M07-20 and control pilot signaling, aligning with expected output. However, it omits important details: the explicit term 'service primitive,' the requirement to retain the 'Matched' state, differentiation of EV (state Bx) vs EVSE (idle/sleep) control pilot actions, and the mechanism for resuming the link (D-LINK_READY.indication). These omissions prevent full alignment with the expected output."

However, it omits details on layer structure (physical, data link, network, application), specific hardware (on-board charger, PLC modem), power interface standards, network transport protocols (TCP/TLS), back-end/grid integration, and detailed protocol steps (SLAC, BCB toggling, aggregator/utility roles). Thus, important architectural and process details are missing."

However, it omits substantial implementation and protocol stack details, such as specifics of signal injection on the Control Pilot line, transmission path considerations, coupling circuitry, physical/MAC layer technicalities (OFDM, spectral masks, SAP types), commissioning details, and EMC/ESD strategies, which are provided in-depth in the Expected Output."

However, it omits explicit mention of the NMK exchange, multi-node broadcast soundings, specific handshake and validation message names (e.g., CM_MNBC_SOUND_IND, CM_SLAC_MATCH_REQ/CNF, CM_VALIDATE_REQ/CNF), and the detail that all messages are raw Ethernet MMEs and conformance tools like Timer_15118_3.

It generalizes security and join/leave function without protocol specifics and misses per-port segmentation between particular EV\u2013EVSE pairs. These omissions reduce completeness."

However, it omits some explicit specifics about provided services (such as specific primitives and examples like D-LINK_READY.indication), protocol identity, and who provides each SAP, which are clearly listed in the expected output. The outputs' descriptions are a bit more general and slightly less precise in terminology (e.g., lacking direct mention of 'Connection Coordination Entity'), leading to some penalty for omission of detail."

However, key technical details are omitted or vague: the actual output does not specify the analog PWM nature of basic signaling, control pilot duty cycle ranges, the precise digital PLC protocol for HLC, message types, or the exact fallback mechanism operational specifics (e.g., pilot duty cycle handling during HLC operation/failure).

However, it omits mention of specific requirement IDs (e.g., V2G5\u2011027, V2G5\u2011028, V2G5\u2011034), proximity resistor monitoring, detailed roles of primary/secondary port mappings, and does not clarify the 'means of test control' designation.

However, it omits much structural detail such as grouping by use case/domain, listing of requirements not covered (Table 27), specifics of the INTERPRETATION and EXECUTION phases, summary of coverage analysis, and the description of adaptors/interfaces, resulting in notable missing detail per Step 2."

However, it omits specific details such as explicit mention of test case hierarchy (test case levels within modules), naming conventions (how IDs and templates are strictly named and cross-referenced), template specifics (e.g. inclusion of message sequences, timing constraints, expected verdicts), explicit delineation of the use of PIXIT parameters, reference to clause 7.2, the nature of informative vs normative annexes, and the explicit use of test case templates referencing utility functions.
