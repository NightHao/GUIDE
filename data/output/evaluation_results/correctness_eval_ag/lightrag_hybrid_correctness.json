        "reason": "The actual output gives a concise general overview of HPGP, accurately describing its use in EV charging, its focus on energy efficiency, and its reference in ISO 15118-3 as mentioned in the expected output. However, it omits significant technical and implementation details present in the expected output, such as the physical signal injection, protocol stack (PHY/MAC), network formation, SLAC protocol details, power management, and coexistence mechanisms. It also lacks specifics on standardization, testing, and exact references to IEC 61851-1 and V2G3-A11-0x requirements. The omissions of these key specifics are heavily penalized per the evaluation steps."

        "reason": "The actual output generally describes SLAC correctly as Signal Level Attenuation Characterization in EV charging, references its standardization in ISO 15118, and its use in signal quality management and matching between EV and EVSE. However, it omits key technical details found in the expected output, such as explicit mention of Mode-3 AC charging, the HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) standard, stepwise protocol operations (like NMK exchange, initialization, specific message codes), matching handshake, and detailed message flows. These omissions result in a significant loss of detail and specificity."

However, it omits significant details present in the expected output: lacks specific mention of IEC 61851-1, PWM analog pilot duty cycles, HLC-C over PLC, precise functional differences, roles in fallback/redundancy, and technical nuances about data capacity or authentication.

While it accurately describes the purpose and context of CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ, it lacks the detailed parameter list, mandatory behavior (e.g., not mentioning that only EVSE should respond), and key references to standards (like the specific hex code 0x6064 and ISO 15118-3/HomePlug Green PHY).
