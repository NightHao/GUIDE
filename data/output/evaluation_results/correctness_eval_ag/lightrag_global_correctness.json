        "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies HPGP as a communication protocol for EV charging and mentions its energy efficiency, role in SLAC, and references ISO 15118. However, it omits significant technical details from the Expected Output, such as the specifics of physical implementation (like signal injection on control pilot/PE lines, transmission path design, coupling components), protocol stack layers (PHY, MAC, network formation), in-depth explanation of SLAC processes, power/coexistence management, exact references to protocols and procedures (like AVLN, CCo, specific message types), and EMC considerations.

        "reason": "The Actual Output provides a general overview of SLAC and covers its use in EV charging, ISO 15118 standards, signal attenuation measurement, and the matching process; however, it omits many essential procedural details and message flow names (such as CM_SLAC_PARM_REQ, CM_MNBC_SOUND_IND, etc.) present in the Expected Output. Also missing are references to HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP), specifics about timers, raw Ethernet encapsulation, conformance testing (TTCN-3), and that SLAC is used specifically in Mode-3 AC charging for socket matching, leading to significant omissions of detail."

        "reason": "The Actual Output does not contradict the Expected Output and correctly states that a logical network is a framework at a low communication layer for secure EV-EVSE data exchange, mentions network keys, segmentation, and ISO 15118-3:2015. However, it omits significant technical detail: it does not mention the Layer-2/Data-Link layer designation, the Central Coordinator (CCo) role, the detailed NMK-based join/leave process, parameter exchanges (e.g., SLAC/MME and CM_SLAC_MATCH), timing (e.g., TP_match_leave), or specifics of network membership/visibility management. This omission of critical details, especially those around network formation/leave, technical layer, and the CCo, warrants a substantial penalty."

While it does not directly contradict the Expected Output, the omission of details about protocol identity, control path vs. data path, specific services, examples (e.g., ETH SAP), and the role of the Connection Coordination Entity means it fails to match the depth or precision required."

It lacks explicit mention of fallback roles, specific IEC 61851-1 details, PLC, and does not elaborate on message types and capabilities (e.g., bandwidth, authentication, tariff signaling) found in the Expected Output.

However, significant omission of detail is present: it does not discuss PICS/PIXIT artifacts, coverage/mapping tables, gaps identification, coverage of specific use cases/domains or authentication profiles, test architecture, interpretation/execution phases, or the reporting/analysis process. Thus, it follows the criteria in outline but lacks much of the specificity and structure described in the Expected Output."

However, it omits key practical details from the expected output, such as specific examples like RFID cards or phone apps, the sequence of EIM in the charging process, and details about test and conformance procedures. Integration with Plug & Charge (PnC) is mentioned but not contrasted as in expected output. Heavy omission of implementation and protocol interaction specifics leads to a deduction."
