        "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies core components like the EV, EVSE, and ISO 15118, and notes the importance of data exchange and protocols. However, it omits critical details found in the Expected Output, such as explicit mention of communication layers (physical, data link, network, application), the role of EVCC and SECC, PLC/SLAC specifics, OCPP/back-end integration, and concrete session steps, resulting in significant loss of essential architectural information."

However, it omits detailed information from the expected output, such as coupling network specifics, protocol stack layers (PHY/MAC/Ethernet SAP details), network formation (CCo, AVLN, SLAC process), per-carrier attenuation, use of IEEE ISP for coexistence, EMC/ESD protections, and explicit references to IEC 61851-1 and V2G3-A11-0x.

Only the high-level context (EV charging, ISO 15118) partially aligns; the rest is inaccurate or far too vague."

The actual output only states that CCo is not mentioned in the provided chunks, which means it fails to deliver any of the required detail from the expected output, but correctly avoids factual contradiction."

Specifically, it misses explicit discussion of link management primitives (e.g. link up/down, error reports, initialization), the Connection Coordination Entity, examples of control primitives, protocol-specific identifiers (e.g. ETH SAP), and the differentiated service roles.
