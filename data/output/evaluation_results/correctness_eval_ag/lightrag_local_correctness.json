        "reason": "The actual output generally describes the V2G layered architecture and communication flows, matching the expected output's structural overview and ISO 15118 references. However, it omits many details: the expected output specifies building blocks like EVCC/SECC, detailed protocols such as SLAC, B1/B2, TCP/TLS, OCPP, exact application messages (SessionStopReq), and grid integration aspects, none of which are explicitly mentioned in the actual output. There are no direct contradictions, but the omission of these technical specifics results in a significantly lower score."

Specifically, it lacks mention of the PLC-based pairing for Mode-3 AC charging, the detailed message flow (e.g., sounding, handshake, and validation steps), the specific standards (ISO 15118-3:2015 A.9, HomePlug GreenPHY 1.1.1), the timers, and low-layer communication modules. There are no factual contradictions, but the omission of key protocol steps, pairing process, and message exchange details as outlined in the Expected Output warrants a strong penalty."

However, it omits significant detail from the expected output: no mention of the Central Coordinator (CCo) role, membership process via SLAC/MME and NMK, join/leave sequences, TP_match_leave, and precise Layer-2 scope, as well as the function for higher-layer protocols. Also missing are specifics on parameter negotiation, network state transitions, and the explicit distinction of one EV\u2013EVSE pair per logical network."

However, it omits significant details present in the expected output: there is no mention of the hierarchical structure, naming conventions, template rules for EVCC/SECC, PICS/PIXIT mechanisms, annexes, or general utility functions.
