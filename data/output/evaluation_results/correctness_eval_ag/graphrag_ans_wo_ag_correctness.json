        "score": 0.5383626977734589,
        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately describes HPGP as a PLC technology for EV charging over control pilot lines, referencing ISO 15118-3:2015 and its role in interoperability, but omits significant technical and implementation details found in the Expected Output (such as coupling methods, protocol stack breakdown, SLAC procedure, power/coexistence management, and specific discussion of standards/testing). No factual contradictions are present, but the omission of these specific details warrants a substantial penalty."

        "score": 0.449181691194749,
        "reason": "The actual output describes SLAC as Signal Level Attenuation Characterization and correctly mentions compliance with ISO 15118-3:2015 and its role in EV-EVSE signal validation, which aligns with the expected output. However, it omits crucial details about SLAC being a PLC-based matching protocol for Mode-3 AC charging, its implementation in the HPGP standard, the multi-step message flows (like MNBC_SOUND, ATTEN_CHAR, MATCH, VALIDATE), PLC timers, specific handshake/matching logic, the use of raw Ethernet/MMEs, and conformance via test suites. Much of the expected procedural or technical detail is missing, resulting in heavy penalization per the criteria."

        "score": 0.6126545002089477,
        "reason": "The actual output is largely accurate and detailed: it correctly identifies the Logical Network's role, Layer-2 basis, segmentation through NMK, management by the low-layer communication module, mentions SLAC, TP Match Leave timers, and encrypted communication. However, it omits explicit mention that this network is software-defined and Layer-2 virtual, only indirectly describing the CCo (Central Coordinator) role, does not describe the join/leave message sequence (e.g. CM_SLAC_MATCH.req/cnf), and doesn't clarify the virtual segmentation feature allowing multiple networks on one medium. Despite some paraphrasing and inclusion of error handling, a few distinguishing technical details about network creation, member tracking, and higher-layer application transparency are missing."

It explains Data SAP as carrying user-data payload and Data Link Control SAP as conveying link-status and error info, matching the Expected Output. It also identifies who provides each SAP. However, it omits some specific details found in the Expected Output, such as explicit mention of control primitives (like D-LINK_READY.indication or D-LINK_TERMINATE.request), matching and initialization procedures, and the protocol-specific nature of Data SAP. These omissions reduce the score."

It fails to explicitly mention control pilot signaling, analog PWM, IEC 61851-1, fallback roles, duty cycles, and specific advanced functions enabled by HLC such as authentication, Plug & Charge, V2G, and dynamic power management.

The actual output omits critical details about their roles, hierarchy, interfaces, and responsibilities as described in the expected output, providing incorrect definitions and unrelated examples, resulting in significant factual inaccuracy and major omissions."

It captures the general role and context but is heavy on generic process detail and lacks technical specifics highlighted in the Expected Output, thus losing points mainly for omission."
