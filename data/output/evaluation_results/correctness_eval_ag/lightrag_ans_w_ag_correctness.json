        "score": 0.5380088319499889,
        "reason": "The actual output provides a high-level overview of V2G architecture and mentions ISO 15118, key components like EV, EVSE, EVCC, SECC, and grid, and touches on bidirectional flow, communication, and management layers. However, it omits substantial technical detail found in the expected output, such as explicit breakdown of OSI layers (physical, data link, network/transport, application), specifics like PLC/SLAC, IPv6/TLS, HLC messages, B1/B2 transitions, SDP, OCPP, and session management events. No factual contradictions are present, but omission of protocol and process detail results in a significant penalty."

        "score": 0.6125907353531743,
        "reason": "The actual output is factually consistent with the expected output and covers the fact that HPGP is a PLC technology used for EV charging and references relevant standards like ISO 15118. However, it omits critical physical implementation details (signal injection, filtering, transmission path considerations, EMC/ESD aspects), lacks breakdowns of the protocol stack (PHY/MAC, AVLN, CCo), specific SLAC matching information, and more granular technical and regulatory details that the expected output provides."

        "score": 0.6044275164166282,
        "reason": "The actual output is mostly factually correct and does not contradict the expected output, but omits key technical details: it fails to specify SLAC as a 'discovery and matching' protocol in Mode-3 AC charging, omits the exact standards (ISO 15118-3:2015 and HPGP 1.1.1), skips key steps such as parameter negotiation, matching handshake, and validation message flows, and lacks detail on the roles of timers, MMEs, and Ethernet encapsulation; thus, there is a major omission of crucial process specifics and context."

        "score": 0.8010334274236721,
        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately covers most technical features from the Expected Output, including Layer 2 scope, the use of NMK for network segmentation and encryption, coexistence of multiple logical networks, join/leave processes (with mention of CM_SLAC_MATCH and D-LINK_READY.indication), and member visibility. However, it omits explicit detail about the EVSE acting as Central Coordinator (CCo), leaves out the timer-based leave process (TP_match_leave), and does not stress the one-to-one binding between a specific EVSE port and a specific EV, or the role in enabling higher-layer protocols. While largely accurate, these omissions prevent a perfect score."

        "reason": "The actual output gives a mostly correct overview, including the CCo's definition, its exclusive role for the EVSE, and details like APCM_SET_CCo.REQ for configuration. However, it omits several specific details present in the expected output such as management of NetID, encryption keys, use of SLAC MMEs for link setup, responses to higher-layer protocol tear down/reconfiguration, and explicit reference to the TT_MATCH_JOIN timer. Omission of these details lowers the score despite the absence of factual contradictions."

        "reason": "The actual output accurately distinguishes between Data SAP and Data Link Control SAP, including their purpose, functionality, layer interaction, and example primitives (like D-LINK_READY.indication and D-LINK_TERMINATE.request). It matches key details from the expected output, such as Data SAP (ETH SAP) handling user-data between Layer 2/3 and link control SAP handling link status and management information, with explicit mention of control/status primitives. Omission is minimal; however, the 'Who Provides It' aspect is less clearly spelled out, and minor protocol/control-plane distinctions could be more explicit."

However, it omits technical details such as the hex code (0x6064), specifics like the requirement numbers (V2G3\u2011A09\u201113, V2G3\u2011A06\u201105), the exact expected values for APPLICATION_TYPE and SECURITY_TYPE (0x00), additional parameter names (slot timing, M-Sound symbol), and detailed timer names (TP_EV_SLAC_init, TT_MATCHING_REPETITION).

It instead describes contents more generically as 'runID, EV MAC address, and other relevant parameters'. While the response is accurate and even adds extra context (test cases, roles in validation), omission of these concrete fields is a notable gap."

However, it consistently (and critically) omits that CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND is sent by the EV to the EVSE (the actual output implies EVSE receives it but never clarifies sender), omits explicit mention of key parameters (C_EV_start_atten_char_inds, TP_EV_batch_msg_interval, V2G3-A09-26), and confuses some roles (suggests the test system or EVSE might send the message), thus losing important directionality and parameterization detail essential per the expected output."

However, it omits crucial protocol-level details such as the specific MME format, MMTYPE identifier, and exact field values (e.g., APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE, SOURCE_ADDRESS). It only briefly mentions test cases and does not cover timer handling or the conformance process (TP_EVSE_avg_atten_calc, TT_EV_atten_results, EV_Discovery_Status update), leading to nontrivial omission of key details found in the expected output."

However, it omits that CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND is a protocol-level SLAC message (not just an 'indicator'); does not detail its role in the SLAC matching process, message contents (attenuation in dB, timestamps, sequence counters), EVSE-side handling (timers, matching sequence, faults), or the message lifecycle.

However, it omits critical technical details such as the presence and usage of fields like 'result' and 'pilot-timer', the requirements for timer values, retry logic, and the fact that a response is always expected (it incorrectly implies a reply may not be required from the EV). These omissions of field details and protocol-specific timer behavior, all present in the expected output, result in a significant penalty for missing important content."
