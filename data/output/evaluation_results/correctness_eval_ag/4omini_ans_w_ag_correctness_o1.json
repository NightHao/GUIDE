        "score": 0.896267310957702,
        "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output on all technical facts, covering core components (EV, EVCC, SECC), ISO 15118, HLC-C, PLC link, SessionStopReq, SDP, the B1/B2 transition, energy flow, and conformance testing. There are no factual contradictions. While the actual output omits a few named test case numbers mentioned in the expected output and some detail (e.g., explicit references to ISO 15118-3, the physical wiring), it nevertheless provides nearly all the details required and all subsystem explanations are correct and specific. Only minor level-of-detail omissions prevent a perfect score."

        "score": 0.9014361833792204,
        "reason": "The actual output covers nearly all relevant technical facts from the expected output, such as HPGP being a powerline communication technology used over existing wiring (including CP line), its application in EV charging and smart grid, ISO 15118/standards references, EMC/ESD protection, notched carriers, and details on network operation. It even adds supporting details (signal management, infrastructure) not present in the expected output. However, some specific expected output elements are only partially detailed or omitted: e.g., explicit mention of data link layer protocols (like SLAC, NIDs, NMKs), and a clearer distinction between HPGP and HomePlug AV (lower rate/cost). Minor omissions prevent a perfect score."

        "score": 0.8088750035901586,
        "reason": "The Actual Output is factually correct and comprehensive, matching Expected Output details like SLAC's purpose, its role in EV and EVSE communication, relevant message types (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ, CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), reference to applicable standards (ISO 15118-3:2015, HomePlug Green PHY), mention of timers (TT_EVSE_SLAC_INIT, TT_MATCH_RESPONSE) and test cases (e.g., TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_CMSLACPARM_012). However, some details are omitted or insufficiently elaborated: the Actual Output does not explicitly explain the full step-by-step SLAC exchange phases (parameter request, sounding, attenuation profile, matching confirmation), misses some message types (e.g., CM_MNBC_SOUND, CM_ATTEN_PROFILE, CM_VALIDATE_REQ/CNF), and omits specific integration references (like Services_PLCLinkStatus, Services_TXPowerLimitation, TTCN-3 usage). Thus, while highly accurate and not factually contradictory, it is missing some detailed enumeration found in the Expected Output."

        "score": 0.903501486058504,
        "reason": "The actual output is detailed and covers all main points from the expected output, including layer 2 operation, management by CCo, membership and segmentation, joining/leaving processes, and EV/EVSE communication. It provides extensive process and component details, matching nearly all expected information.

        "reason": "The Actual Output closely matches the Expected Output in terms of factual content, accurately describing the CCo's roles in network management, link termination, device monitoring, MME usage, and configuration requirements (including V2G3-A06-02 and APCM_SET_CCo.REQ). It mentions that CCo should not be assigned to the EV, aligning with the standard. There is a slight omission regarding the explicit assignment of CCo typically to the EVSE side, and the detailed point about higher-layer roles instructing the CCo to add/remove links is less explicit, but no factual contradictions are present and almost all details are covered."

No contradictions are present, and virtually all details from the expected output are covered. There is a minor omission of the explicit 'user-level data' language and a slight overuse of general overviews, but all specific technical points are addressed."

All expected output details\u2014including PWM, protocol layers, backup behavior, and examples like Plug and Charge\u2014are discussed. While wordier, it omits almost no factual content, only lacking explicit mention of certain standard codes (e.g., V2G3-M06-02), so minor detail loss is present but overall coverage is highly complete and non-contradictory."

        "reason": "The actual output closely matches the expected output and covers the key differences in roles, integration, communication, and functions of MTC and PTC. It addresses that MTC is the primary controller (macro-level, test orchestration, verdict assignment, configuration) and PTC is for parallel, ongoing monitoring (EIM, PWM, duty cycle, reporting to MTC). It also correctly mentions integration ports and types of testers for both, aligning with the expected output. However, it omits specific implementation requirement references (like V2G5-027 and V2G5-028) and is less explicit about the rationale for running PTC in parallel to avoid pausing the MTC, resulting in a minor loss of detail."

It also references V2G5-038 like the Expected Output. The only very minor omission is the phrase 'test framework' (TFW) as the routine execution environment, and perhaps does not explicitly mention 'static' vs 'dynamic' conformance using those exact terms, though it alludes to them. There is no contradiction or significant missing detail."

        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.75,
        "reason": "The Actual Output closely matches the Expected Output by explaining TSS as a framework for organizing test cases, mentioning ISO 15118, EVCC, SECC, PICS/PIXIT, templates, annexes, and section D.4. However, it omits key details such as explicit mention of section 7.2, hierarchical organization, module identifiers, grouping by use cases, and the methodical traceability to requirements. The omission of these specific structural and tracing aspects results in some loss of detail."

        "score": 0.8939913355716923,
        "reason": "The actual output accurately explains EIM as defined in ISO 15118-1, describes its use for identification/authorization in EV charging, mentions its application in both AC and DC charging, and covers its role in data exchange and in conjunction with Plug and Charge. However, it omits concrete examples of external credentials (like card or code), lacks explicit mention of EIM replacing or running alongside other authentication methods, and is heavier on technical process details while missing the simple, practical explanation found in the expected output."

It adds extra but relevant detail (test cases) without contradicting, but it only very slightly omits some sequencing nuances (such as mentioning CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND as the preceding step more explicitly). Otherwise, it is otherwise complete and matches the expected factual detail."

The omission of mention of V2G3-A09-37 and the slightly less explicit clarification about the message being used more generally 'between SLAC nodes' (not strictly only EVSE->EV) are very minor gaps. All facts are consistent, and essential technical content is included, but these minor omissions prevent a perfect score."

It references the same V2G3-A09-37 standard and testing scenarios including invalid fields. Very minor omissions exist such as less explicit mention of requirements from V2G3-A06-05 and the loop-closing function, but all required technical points and test case considerations are included concisely."

It captures technical field names, requirement numbers (V2G3-A09-76, etc.), and test or validation processes. However, it omits reference to SLAC and specific test case names mentioned in the expected output (e.g., TC_EVCC_CMN_VTB_CMVALIDATE_00x), and lacks some nuance about exact timer error-handling scenarios, causing a slight deduction."

It also explains the protocol compliance and message structure.

No contradictions are present.

Test case and standards relevance (V2G3-A09-95, V2G3-A09-101) are mentioned as in the Expected Output. Some groups of information, such as explicit mention of AVLN establishment and the use of TP_match_response, are slightly less emphasized, leading to a very minor omission, but there is no contradictory fact.

There is no factual contradiction. The only minor omission is that the actual output has more general descriptions and adds background (e.g., mentioning the protocol template role of MME and more about the configuration process), while the expected output is slightly more concise regarding sequence (such as stating NMK is used for authenticating device membership)."

It provides extra information about MMEs and transmission power values, which is not required but not incorrect.
