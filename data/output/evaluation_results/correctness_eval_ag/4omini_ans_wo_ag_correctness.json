        "reason": "The actual output accurately includes core architectural components (EV, EVSE, EVCC, SECC), ISO 15118 conformance, and general communication protocol structure. However, it omits specific layered details such as the explicit breakdown into Physical/Power, Data Link, Network/Transport, and Application Layers, and misses detailed mentions of mechanisms like SLAC, PLCLinkStatus, TCP/TLS session management, service discovery protocol (SDP), B1/B2 and BCB transitions, and integration with upstream OCPP/grid backend systems. These omissions represent a loss of architectural granularity and important system behaviors found in the expected output."

However, there are notable omissions of detail: the specific physical implementation (signal injection via control pilot, coupling circuit details), in-depth protocol stack elements (AVLN, CCo, SAPs), details on commissioning (SLAC, message types), adjustable power/transmission profile, EMC/ESD protection, and standardization/testing specifics are missing. The actual output is comprehensive at a high level but lacks the deep technical granularity outlined in the expected output."

        "reason": "The actual output correctly defines SLAC, references ISO 15118-3 and HomePlug Green PHY standards, identifies low-layer communication modules in EV and EVSE, and discusses signal strength measurement. However, it omits many details from the expected output, such as the PLC-based discovery and matching protocol for pairing EVs to socket-outlets, specific message names and protocol steps (CM_SLAC_PARM_REQ, CM_MNBC_SOUND_IND, CM_ATTEN_CHAR_IND, etc.), the NMK exchange for secure network joining, and detailed conformance testing aspects. No facts contradict, but significant detail is omitted."

        "reason": "The actual output correctly describes the logical network as a secure, segmented layer allowing EV\u2013EVSE communication, mentions the use of NMK, encrypted payloads, SLAC parameter exchange, and network segmentation, in line with the expected output. However, it omits key specifics: it does not mention the Layer-2 or Data-Link layer scope, the EVSE's low-layer module as the Central Coordinator (CCo), the requirement to revert to an 'Unmatched' state and timing (TP_match_leave) on leave, and how the logical network enables higher-layer protocols and tracking by the EVSE. These omissions of detail result in a deduction."

However, it omits major details such as specific roles of network management, assignment/management of NetID and encryption keys, use of SLAC MMEs, precise mechanisms for link/control management, and the exact control relationship with upper layers. It misses that the EVSE always becomes the CCo, the enforcement of precisely one CCo, and the use of the APCM_SET_CCo.REQ primitive, leading to substantial penalties for omitted details."

        "reason": "The actual output accurately distinguishes Data SAP as handling user data transfer between the data link and higher layers, and Data Link Control SAP as handling management/control functions, consistent with the expected output. It also references ISO 15118 and provides context, purpose, and functionality for both. However, some detailed protocol-specific terminology from the expected output is omitted (e.g., direct mention of ETH SAP, specific examples like D\u2011LINK_READY.indication, and responsibilities such as frame encapsulation/decapsulation), so there is light penalization for omission of fine-grained detail."

However, it omits specific technical details present in the expected output, such as the names and specifics of signal types (PWM, control pilot line), clear references to analog vs digital (PLC), bandwidth capabilities, message frame structure, required/optional use, and how fallback works in precise terms. There are no contradictions, but the actual output is less technical and drops several low-level distinctions, justifying a moderate penalty for omission of detail."

It mentions protocol monitoring and event handling by PTCs, and that MTC assigns verdicts, creates PTCs, and adapts its identity. However, the actual output omits specific implementation details present in the expected output, such as exact port mappings (e.g., HAL_61851_Internal_Port), specific IEC requirements (V2G5-027, V2G5-028, V2G5-034), and does not mention the exact mapping of ports or the secondary-sided, listener-only nature of PTC.

However, it omits key details like explicit mention of PICS, PIXIT, phases of interpretation/execution, distinction between what and how, and does not reference coverage tables or known gaps in ATS.

However, it omits or only vaguely mentions some key details present in the Expected Output such as the explicit reference to clause 7.2 of ISO 15118-3, strict naming conventions, detailed explanation of templates and annexes (e.g., Annex D.4), and precise role in linking conformance requirements from ISO 15118-3.

However, it omits significant detail about EIM's practical forms (RFID, app), its explicit alternative role to Plug & Charge, specific protocol/component flow (V2G3\u2011M06\u201104, SECC, etc.), and the detailed stepwise sequence at charge initiation, which lessens completeness."

However, it omits critical technical details present in the expected output, such as the specific fields and their functions (Result field, actual parameter values, ToggleNum), and inaccurately states the direction of the message (SUT vs. EVSE/EVCC) in places.

However, it is vague about which device sends the message (the actual output erroneously attributes it to the EVSE in the context introduction rather than the EV), omits specific content fields (e.g., applicationType, securityType, runID, etc.), omits encoding details (MME/Table A.4), testing specifics (conformance test case names), and does not mention timing constraints (TP_match_sequence) or the relevant low-layer module note from the standard.
