        "reason": "The actual output covers the main purpose and applications of HPGP (smart grid, EV charging, use over existing wiring, low power, SLAC protocol, interoperability), but omits significant technical details found in the expected output: no in-depth mention of OFDM and band-notching, coupling circuit details, regulatory/standards references like ISO 15118, IEC 61851, specific protocol stack elements (SAPs, Central Coordinator Manager), security (NID/NMK), specific SLAC messages, EMC/ESD safeguards, or low-layer comm module requirements. No technical coupling, insertion loss, EMC, or standards language details, so detail omission is penalized."

However, it omits some critical specifics: does not explicitly mention the Central Coordinator (CCo) or its role, the specific SLAC and CM_SLAC_MATCH naming, or explicit error/leaving behaviors (EV_Discovering_status and D-LINK_TERMINATE). Most technical details match, and there are no direct contradictions with the expected output, but omission of precise terminologies and certain details justifies deduction."

The actual output omits very specific field values (APPLICATION_TYPE = 0x00, SECURITY_TYPE = 0x00, RunID role, C_EV_match_MNBC parameter) and misses the instruction that the low-layer EV module must not respond, and does not cite the exact test case names or parameter IDs, leading to a small deduction for detail omissions."

However, it omits significant details present in the expected output, such as exact field definitions (APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE), specific byte sizes, the computation method of ATTEN_PROFILE entries, and does not specify that the message must be ignored if NUM_SOUNDS is zero. Also, there is no mention of TT_EV_ATTEN_RESULTS or TP_EVSE_avg_atten_calc timers, and lacks clarity that the message is specifically MME-level and carried as an MME record.
