It closely mirrors the structure, gives tables and figures referenced in the expected output, and elaborates on the role of PICS/PIXIT, functions, and annexes.

It gives precise information about EIM workflow variants (before/after plug-in, with/without BC), the table structure matches the expected output, and it explains both AC and DC EVSE cases. The only minor omission is that the actual output ambiguously mentions EIM as also referring to 'Electricity Information Management,' which could cause confusion, and doesn't state EIM is one of only two primary authorization methods (with Plug and Charge) as highlighted in the expected.

It also makes clear the reply sequence (REQ\u2192CNF). Minor detail is omitted regarding the 'default amplitude map' if no exchange is triggered and it is less explicit about AMLEN/AMDATA specifics in REQ, but otherwise no contradictions or key omissions are noted."

Small omissions include less explicit references to certain ISO 15118-3 clauses, Figures 10/11, and some performance timer values, but these are minor.

It includes details about the acknowledgment, message structure (referring to Table A.4), timers (like TT_match_response), retransmission logic, and matches most of the function and validation steps in the expected output. Omission is minimal, mainly missing explicit mention of TT_EV_atten_results and a stepwise sequence chart reference, but all critical details are present without contradiction."

It covers the two-step request-response exchanges, MME field layouts, result codes, EV/EVSE behavior, timers, the control pilot toggle process, and sequence chart references. However, there is some minor omission of deep detail on the asynchronous nature (actual output briefly mentions unmatched EVSE response but omits language about asynchronicity), and some paraphrased but structurally similar explanation of failure handling and field validation. Sequence chart and table references are present. Detail is robust but not always as explicit as in the expected output regarding ignoring invalid requests or the behavior for invalid content. This omission is minor, justifying a slight point deduction."

It references MME messages and relevant tables/figures. However, small omissions exist: it does not mention the initial CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ/RESP parameter exchange before SLAC starts, and lacks some specific parameter value definitions (e.g., APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE values for MMEs, and the precise number of carrier groups reported in CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND). These omissions are minor and do not introduce factual contradiction, but heavy detail omission is penalized per the instructions, so the score is just under perfect."

There is close fact alignment (no contradictions), references to correction factors (AttnRx-EVSE), message flows, parameters (C_EV_match_MNBC, timeouts), and procedural steps. However, minor omissions exist: the actual output lacks mention of certain specific parameter names (e.g., C_EV_start_atten_char_inds, C_EV_match_signalattn_direct/indirect, TT_EV_atten_results), and slightly condenses the receive-path correction explanation. These few missing specifics result in a small deduction in score."

However, it omits granular detail such as explicit drawing references (Figure A.10), full cable/component values (e.g., exact 220 \u00b5H inductance, 1.35 nF C_PLC, 1.3 Vpp, crosstalk levels), and PSD measurement methods cited in the Expected Output, so minor score deduction for omission."

However, some details are omitted, such as specific mention of MAC-level arbitration, single device CCo role enforcement, CAP3 priority for matching, and exclusions regarding which management messages the EV side should ignore. The signal injection context and protocol adaptation details are also not mentioned, resulting in some loss of detail compared to the expected output."

It accurately describes the process flow (EV sends CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, then CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND, EVSE measures M-SOUND, replies with CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), and mapping to standards (ISO 15118-3, HomePlug Green PHY). However, it omits some minor details: it does not mention the use of CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP or the EV_Discovery_Status thresholds (EVSE_FOUND, EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, EVSE_NOT_FOUND, and attenuation dB threshold values), which are present in the expected output. There are no fact contradictions, but the omission of downstream status determination prevents a perfect score."

It even adds clarification around duplicate requests and message validation. The omission of explicit reference to figures/tables like 'Figure\u00a0A.8', and the lack of explicitly mentioning the placeholder 'References' section from the expected output are the only minor gaps, but overall the actual output is highly complete and accurate, with no contradictions or major omissions."
