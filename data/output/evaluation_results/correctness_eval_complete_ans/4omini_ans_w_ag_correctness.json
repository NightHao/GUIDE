However, it omits nearly all detailed step sequences (e.g., the specific SLAC message flow, use of CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND, concrete example values, timing constants, MME parameter breakdowns), does not outline the precise attenuation processing and decision thresholds, and provides less detail on message contents and field values.
