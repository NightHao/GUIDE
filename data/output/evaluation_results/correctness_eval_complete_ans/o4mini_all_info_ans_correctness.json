        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.8817574482861008,
        "reason": "The actual output includes all key facts from the expected output such as the definition, characteristics (layer-2, NMK, network segmentation), joining and leaving processes, SLAC matching, NID derivation, and purpose. Most technical details, references, and standard clauses are covered. However, some fine details are slightly condensed or omitted, such as the explicit mention of Figure A.7 (joining sequence), description that EVSE 'must set its local NMK to a random value to ensure uniqueness,' and explicit revert to default parameters upon leaving. Overall, the output is comprehensive but misses a few minor specifics."

        "question": "What is the difference between MTC and PTC?",
        "score": 0.9500000000000002,
        "reason": "The actual output covers all major facts from the expected output, including roles, ports, references to ISO 15118-5 clauses, distinctions between MTC and PTC, and even tables summarizing differences. Specifics such as SUT types, communication, and port assignment are present. However, there is minor omission of nuance: the description that the MTC creates/controls one or more PTCs and that the PTC 'reports back' to the MTC is less explicitly stated. Otherwise, detail is comprehensive, with no contradiction."

        "score": 0.8939913351929898,
        "reason": "The actual output correctly outlines the definition, message fields, sequence, timing, and error handling for CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ as in the expected output, referencing relevant ISO 15118-3 clauses and tables. It captures the purpose, when and how the message is sent, detailed field breakdowns, and steps for handling and error cases, matching the expected output in both technical accuracy and sequence detail. The omission of mention of the NMK/NID exchange in the CNF that follows the REQ and a slightly briefer explanation of higher-layer joining reduce the score slightly, but all key protocol-level points are present and uncontradicted."

        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.9148047199911161,
        "reason": "The actual output closely matches the expected output: it covers the core elements of TSS, provides detailed hierarchical structure, explicitly enumerates identifiers with their values, and details the role of annexes, all in agreement with the expected output. No fact in the actual output contradicts the expected output. A minor omission is the less explicit detailing of the broader definition and lifecycle of a test profile (configuration, component/port definitions), and the output focuses on ISO 15118-5 instead of explicit reference to 15118-3; despite this, all major details from the expected output are present."

It also includes details on link establishment, sequence, and error conditions. Minor penalization for slight omissions in named clause references (expected output cites A.9.5 directly, actual cites A.9.4.2/sequence tables) and less explicit enumeration of the figure sequence steps, but otherwise thorough and correct, with no factual contradictions or significant omissions."

        "score": 0.9622459324198198,
        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately covers all technical facts in the Expected Output, including the definition, purpose, message sequence, timing constraints, and detailed field definitions for CM_SET_KEY.REQ.

        "reason": "The actual output provides accurate technical details about CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, correctly explaining its SLAC context, message flow, field structure, calculations, and key thresholds (such as 10 dB and 20 dB), matching much of the expected output. However, it omits details on the EVSE retry process, parameter C_EV_match_retry, and explicit status mappings for EVSE_FOUND, EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, and EVSE_NOT_FOUND (with associated flow and Table A.3 descriptions). Most facts align, with little contradiction, but minor omissions in handling and post-message sequencing prevent a perfect score."

        "reason": "The actual output accurately defines EIM, cites ISO 15118-1/-3, distinguishes EIM from PnC, and provides detailed examples and operational sequences, matching the expected output. It sufficiently covers abbreviation, purpose, examples, sequence timing (before/after plug-in), operational branches (with or without BC), and behavior on EIM success/failure. The main minor omission is the lack of explicit mention or formatting of the detailed control-pilot state transition (E or F to X1/X2, [V2G3-M06-08]) and a summarized Table structure for coordination sequences, which appears in the expected output. However, these gaps are small and most technical details are covered, so only a slight penalty for detail omission is warranted."

        "score": 0.9,
        "reason": "The actual output closely matches the expected output in terms of facts and detail: it accurately explains the purpose, broadcast context, key parameters, and message flow for CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND using ISO 15118-3 references. No material factual contradictions occur. There is a minor omission: the actual output does not mention the EV responding with CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP to each CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, and is less explicit about the end-state determination (EVSE_FOUND, etc.), slightly reducing completeness."

All field values and steps are correctly mapped, and most references and context match. However, the Actual Output omits some detail on EV behavior upon receiving CNF, lacks explicit mentions of the relation to overall matching flow (Figure 10), and does not list all specific retry timer names and field checking rules given in Expected Output. These omissions are minor, so slight deduction for missing fine-grained procedural details."

It does not add contradictions, includes more specific timeouts (e.g., TT_match_response, TP_match_response), message structure, and refers to relevant V2G3 requirements as in the Expected Output. No significant omissions or contradictions found."

        "reason": "The Actual Output is factually consistent with the Expected Output and covers essential details: the definition, purpose, trigger, entity, and timing (TP_match_leave, T_conn_resetup). It correctly describes Control Pilot transitions, error trigger, network termination, and references the proper ISO clauses and tables. However, significant omission of detail is evident: it lacks comprehensive and separate EV behavior steps, omits state transitions (e.g., X1/X2/E/F specificity), doesn't fully enumerate options for both EVSE and EV with associated V2G references, omits T_step_EF, and related primitives (like D-LINK_READY) mentioned in the Expected Output. The summary in Expected Output is also richer in procedural detail."

It omits only the explicit mention of the Network Membership Key (NMK) reset, comparison to D-LINK_ERROR.request, and the note regarding D-LINK_TERMINATE.request providing faster termination than natural network detection. Most critical details are present, with only a few minor omissions."

It details scenarios like matching, wake-up, logical network setup/leave, error handling, and includes relevant standards references. There are no contradictions. A slight omission is less explanation about the EV point-of-view flow and control-pilot loss scenarios, so a minor detail penalty applies."

It covers all relevant standard parts (ISO 15118-1/2/3, IEC 61851-1), layers 1-7, hardware control path, service primitive interface, specific message flows, and references. Slight omission exists regarding 'Service Access Points' details and some specific network/session layer activities found in the expected output, but no factual contradictions or significant omissions are present."

Message field details, proportionate to the expected output, are included. Minor omissions such as not describing the requirement for the EVSE to correct attenuation by adding insertion loss and lack of an explicit note about weighted averaging versus arithmetic mean are present, but these do not contradict or significantly exclude facts. No contradiction of facts; detail is highly comprehensive."

Although all key details from input and expected output are included\u2014even extended\u2014some minor expansion details (like phrasing of fallback scenarios and the use of 'detailed description' of ISO-2 periods) are summarized rather than deeply elaborated.

Minor omissions exist: the actual output lacks details about the CAP3 priority rationale and the context of signal injection onto the control pilot line as noted in the expected output's section 5.

However, it omits specific matching thresholds (C_EV_match_signalattn_direct/indirect, Average_Attenuation, EV_Discovery_Status values) and the explicit link to the HomePlug Green PHY SLAC profile, both present in the expected output.
