It captures the general function (HPGP for PLC over pilot line in EV charging per ISO 15118) and mentions SLAC and some testing, but lacks specifics such as the parallel-injection physical setup, key signal requirements, and does not define symbols or core circuit considerations as outlined in the expected output."

However, it omits or insufficiently details crucial procedural points present in the Expected Output, such as the precise SLAC message sequence (like CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND and M\u2011SOUNDS), the numerical protocol constants, detailed Management Message Entries (MMEs), timing requirements, matching algorithms, and detailed SLAC flow as outlined in the standard; this significant lack of procedural and technical detail is heavily penalized."
