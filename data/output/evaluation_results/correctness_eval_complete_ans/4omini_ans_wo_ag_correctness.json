        "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies key system components (EV, EVSE, communication controllers) and references ISO 15118 but omits critical OSI-layered architecture details, explicit mappings of ISO 15118-1, -2, -3 to OSI layers, explanations of service primitive interfaces, PHY/MAC specifics, and key use cases found in the expected output. There is no contradiction, but heavy detail from the expected output is absent."

        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately defines HPGP, its role in EVSE-EV communication, its compliance with ISO 15118, mentions modulation/frequency plan, coupling, and power line use. However, it omits significant technical details from the Expected Output such as the use of the 1 kHz control-pilot line, specific injection circuit diagram, parameter values (e.g., C_PLC, R-damp, L), cable length limit, PSD, and peak voltage specs. There is no contradiction, but lack of granular detail and omission of key numbers results in a lower score."

However, it omits critical technical details, such as the specific MMEs (message names and fields), the exact sequence of message exchanges, the parameter and timing requirements (e.g., C_EV_match_MNBC, Table A.1), and the attenuation processing and decision logic using status thresholds (EVSE_FOUND, etc.) as described in the expected output. The omission of these specifics significantly reduces the completeness and utility of the response."

However, it omits several detailed specifics: ISO 15118-3 clause references, explicit mention of layer 2, NID derivation, timing constraint (TP_match_leave = 1 s), references to precise table/figure numbers, and certain process details (e.g., notification of HLE by D-LINK_READY.indication). No contradictory facts are introduced, but omission of these specifics results in a deduction."

However, the Actual Output omits fine details from the Expected Output, such as specific references to primitive operations (e.g., D-LINK_READY.indication), control commands, and exact naming from ISO 15118-3 clauses.

However, it omits important specific details such as the exact breakdown of phases in high-level communication, precise fallback behavior of PWM duty cycle, clause references (like [V2G3\u2011M06\u201103]), and clear mention that basic signaling is always used regardless of HLC presence.

However, it omits several key details from the expected output: (1) the precise scope, per ISO 15118-5 (Part 5), with emphasis on the PLC-based High Level Communication and the SUT variants (EVCC/SECC); (2) it lacks discussion of PICS/PIXIT tables, test identifiers, and standard clause references; (3) specific exclusions (performance, robustness, power flow, implementation) and the objectives around interoperability are not addressed. Abbreviation details and summary tables are missing, leading to lost clarity and depth, but there are no factual contradictions."

However, it omits detailed breakdowns such as explicit hierarchical levels (Level 1/2), specifics on test profiles, and annexes (A-G) referenced in the expected output.

However, it omits key technical details specified in the expected output, such as the complete MME structure (field names, values, and octet locations), specific error-handling logic, retransmission behavior, and timer values (TT_match_response, TP_EV_SLAC_init, etc.). Furthermore, the actual output incorrectly uses 'CM_SLAC_PARAM.CNF' instead of 'CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF' and lacks the explicit functional step-by-step and timing interactions present in the expected output."

However, it omits multiple critical implementation details: exact timing, multiple transmissions (i.e., repeated C_EV_start_atten_char_inds times), specific structure fields (APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE, etc.), broadcast nature, the unicast CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND response, configuration parameter values, and compliance/timing requirements. These omissions and lack of granular details result in a significant penalty."

However, it omits key specifics from the expected output: the direct role of CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND as a trigger for an 'M-Sound' emission, the preliminary sending of CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND messages, explicit values for constants and timing (e.g., typical number 10, 3 start indications, 20\u201350ms interval), threshold values and their effect on EV_Discovery_Status, and mentions of figures/tables for sequence and parameter reference.

However, it omits key procedural details: the role of M-SOUNDs, the explicit computation of Average_Attenuation by the EV, profile/group mean calculations, what triggers the message, responses and retransmissions, precise handling requirements, and EV_Discovering_Status logic.

However, it omits critical specifics: it does not clearly state the EV sends CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP in direct acknowledgment of each CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, is vague about Annex A of ISO 15118-3, lacks mention of key timers and parameters (like TT_EV_atten_results, C_EV_match_signalattn_direct/indirect), does not detail message structure per MME/Table A.4, and misses the sequence specifics.
