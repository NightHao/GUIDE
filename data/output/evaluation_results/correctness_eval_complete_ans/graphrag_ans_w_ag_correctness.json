        "score": 0.46294566553362204,
        "reason": "The actual output correctly mentions ISO 15118 and distinguishes some aspects of system architecture and certain technical requirements, but omits a clear, layered OSI-based breakdown as structured in the expected output. It lacks explicit mapping of ISO 15118-3, -2, and -1 to OSI layers and details about the 'V2G standardized service primitive interface,' as well as the specific role of each OSI layer in the architecture. While some component details and references to standards are present, significant structural and technical details from the expected output are missing."

        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies HPGP as HomePlug Green PHY, its purpose for data over power lines, and references ISO 15118-3, but omits almost all technical and implementation details found in the expected output such as signal coupling, injection topology (Figure A.10), exact electrical characteristics (e.g., component values, PSD), and key terminology. No factual contradictions are present, but there is heavy omission of critical details."

        "score": 0.30730089617792944,
        "reason": "The actual output contains a broadly correct high-level explanation of SLAC, including its context within HomePlug Green PHY and its purpose of measuring signal attenuation; however, it omits nearly all of the essential procedural details, protocol message names (e.g., CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), compliance requirements, matching process steps, and parameters as extensively outlined in the expected output. No direct contradictions are present, but the heavy omission of details beyond the high-level summary significantly reduces the score."

        "score": 0.6859740767698344,
        "reason": "The actual output correctly explains that a logical network is a layer 2 construct per ISO 15118-3, consists of mutually visible members, enforces segmentation, and details that the NID is derived from the NMK. It also covers creation/parameter exchange and joining/leaving procedures, but omits mention of specific message names like 'CM_SLAC_MATCH', timing constraints (e.g. TP_match_leave = 1s), revert to default behavior, and the sequence chart reference. Most facts do not contradict, but some procedural detail is omitted."

        "reason": "The actual output provides accurate core facts about the CCo as the manager in HPGP networks, notes the EV should not be CCo, and references APCM_SET_CCo.REQ, matching expected info. However, it omits multiple configuration details from ISO 15118-3 such as EVSE side requirements, necessity of CCo mode before SLAC-based matching, handling of CAP3 priority, and EV limitations responding to certain messages or differences in signal injection, warranting penalty for significant omitted detail."

However, it omits key technical details from the expected output, such as ISO 15118-3 references, exact definitions from standard clauses, functional equivalence to Ethernet-II SAP, specific characteristic lists, example SAP names, a comparative summary table, and explicit mention of V2G payload transport. The actual output remains general and inferred, leading to heavy penalization for omission of detail."

        "reason": "The actual output accurately distinguishes basic signaling from high-level communication, referencing standards (IEC-1, ISO-2), and explains bidirectional signaling and purposes. However, it omits important operational details from the expected output: it does not mention signal timing requirements, backup functionality of basic signaling during HLC failure, specific operational phases of HLC (Data Link Setup, V2G Setup, V2G Charging Loop), or the fixed PWM duty cycle during HLC. These omissions result in a loss of technical precision and completeness."

However, it omits important ISO 15118-5 clause references, explicit mention of TTCN-3, specific examples of concrete MTC/PTC types (e.g., SECC_Tester, EVCC_Tester, HAL_61851_Listener), details on port interactions and mapping to TSI, and test-case lifeline ownership. Thus, detail omission leads to point deductions."

However, it omits many key details from the Expected Output: no mention of the verification scopes (physical and data link layers), relevant communication controllers (EVCC/SECC), test architecture (TTCN-3, OSI Layers), PICS/PIXIT purpose or examples, specific tables (27-30, 6-11), exact exclusions (e.g., power flow, performance), and test coverage symbols.

        "reason": "The actual output largely matches the expected output on high-level facts about the TSS (purpose, organization by use case/domain, inclusion of test cases, PICS, PIXIT, and utility functions) and does not introduce contradictions. However, it omits significant detail from the expected output, such as the test suite\u2019s coverage of ISO 15118-3 specifically (focusing on -5), the explicit hierarchy (functions, modules, annexes), identification of SUT roles (EVCC, SECC), breakdown of annexes, and a concrete outline of profiles, identifiers, and structures given in the expected output."

However, it omits significant details such as comparison with Plug and Charge (PnC), explicit citation of ISO 15118-3 control-pilot requirements, the specific connection coordination sequences outlined in figures, and the nuanced timing and charging mode distinctions (EIM w/ BC vs. EIM w/o BC). The omission of these details and lack of reference to how EIM sequences are handled in various AC and DC scenarios leads to a substantial detail deficit, though there are no direct factual contradictions."

However, it omits crucial protocol details found in the expected output, such as the low-layer broadcast method, specific field contents (APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE, RunID), precise triggering events, retries, error handling scenarios, and extensive timing references. Missing much core detail results in a low score."

It also incorrectly references ISO 15118-5 instead of ISO 15118-3. No direct contradiction in facts, but substantial omission of required specifics."

However, it omits important details found in the Expected Output: there is no mention of ISO 15118-3 or HomePlug SLAC standards, M\u2011Sound physical transmission, that each message triggers an actual M\u2011Sound burst, details of the SLAC signal-strength measurement procedure (such as EVSE reporting, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND responses, threshold parameters, the process of setting EV_Discovery_Status), or specific parameter values (like typical 10 for C_EV_match_MNBC or timing details).

However, it omits key details such as the entire step-by-step matching sequence, explicit roles of EV and EVSE, the importance of CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP responses, timer/retry mechanisms (TT_match_response, C_EV_match_retry), calculation and use of Average_Attenuation, the logic for EV_Discovering_Status, and parameter thresholds (e.g., C_EV_match_signalattn_direct/indirect).

However, it omits critical technical detail such as message octet structure, exact field names/definitions, timing constraints, error handling (invalid CNF handling, link join timeout), and specific process steps outlined in Figure A.2 and Table A.7 referenced by the expected output.
