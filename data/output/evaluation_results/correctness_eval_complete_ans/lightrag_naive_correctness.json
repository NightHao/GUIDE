        "reason": "The actual output covers the main components, ISO 15118 parts, HomePlug Green PHY, communication protocols, and some OSI layering concepts from the expected output. However, it omits critical detail on the specific OSI layer mapping, connection coordination, precise service primitive interface roles, and a detailed breakdown of Layers 3-7 functions. Expected Output\u2019s modularity, SAP types, and layered interface abstraction are not explicitly mentioned, resulting in loss of important detail."

        "score": 0.4767583391588355,
        "reason": "The actual output accurately states HPGP is for PLC communication between EVSE and EV over the control pilot, referencing ISO 15118 and mentioning the algebraic sum of PWM and HPGP signals. However, it excludes key numerical and technical details from the expected output, such as component values (e.g., C_PLC 1.35 nF, R_damp 220\u03a9, L 220\u03bcH), signal requirements (1.3 Vpp, \u201375 dBm/Hz PSD), and thorough schematic description, which penalizes the output for omitted detail."

        "score": 0.20758581768873632,
        "reason": "The actual output introduces several inaccuracies: it defines SLAC as 'Smart Load and Charge' rather than the correct 'Signal Level Attenuation Characterization' stated in both the Input and Expected Output, and misrepresents its function as relating to smart charging and load management, while omitting the detailed sequence, message exchanges, and attenuation computation steps integral to SLAC according to the Expected Output. Key technical details such as specific message types (e.g., CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND) and the HomePlug Green PHY context are entirely omitted, leading to heavy penalties for both factual contradiction and omission of detail."

However, it omits important details like the OSI layer (layer 2), the allowance for coexistence of multiple logical networks on the same medium, specific sequence chart reference (Figure A.7), timing parameter TP_match_leave, required actions when leaving, and does not specify the precise definition per ISO 15118-3 clause 3.16. The omission of these specifics substantially reduces completeness."

While it doesn't contradict the Expected Output, it fails to provide any substantive information present in the Expected Output, stating only the absence of information."

Many specific characteristics, protocol relationships, and mechanism details present in the expected output are missing, leading to major penalization for omission despite no direct factual contradiction."

However, it omits several important implementation details: it does not mention that the MTC is a single component in each test configuration, is responsible for creating/controlling PTCs, computes the test verdict, owns specific ports for SLAC and HAL_61851, nor that the PTC is instantiated by the MTC, lacks independent timers/variables, and always communicates via pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port. Concrete port names and standard PTC example HAL_61851_Listener are incompletely addressed, and component-port interaction details are mostly omitted, thus warranting a deduction for detail omission."

It omits control-pilot requirements, Table 1, and details such as the EIM/BC/HLC branching, supporting sequences, or transition steps stated in the Expected Output.

However, there is noticeable omission of detail: it does not mention specific field sizes/values (e.g., octets, 0x00), lacks explanation of error handling scenarios, omits several specific timing parameter values (e.g., max 10s, 100ms, 400ms, etc.), does not reference permitted retry counts or procedural examples (like C_EV_match_retry or A.9.8.1 boot-up scenario), and does not specify details about message direction (broadcast to unicast).

Multiple key details about participants, message counts, context, and purpose are missing from the actual output. While there are no factual contradictions, omission of detail is significant."
