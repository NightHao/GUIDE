        "score": 0.8679178692681615,
        "reason": "The Actual Output aligns very closely with the Expected Output: it details MTC and PTC roles, definitions, types, ports, and their collaboration, citing ISO 15118 clauses and references. All crucial technical details are covered, including test control, port mapping, component interactions, and specific type names (SECC_Tester, EVCC_Tester, HAL_61851_Listener). Minor omissions exist\u2014such as less emphasis on the PTC\u2019s lack of its own timers/variables and the note about port exposure to TSI versus internal ports\u2014but these are minor and do not contradict or significantly omit factual content."

It omits some specific process steps such as the role of BCB-toggle validation, the explicit description of the sequence flow with D-LINK_READY/CM_SET_KEY/NMK/NID exchange, and the granularity of context on HomePlug Green PHY logic, which are present in the expected output. However, it does not introduce any contradictions and provides precise technical detail, only missing some contextual and flow steps."

No factual contradictions were found. There is very minor detail omission in describing the hierarchical levels (Levels 1 and 2 are not explicitly named or described in the same hierarchy as Figure 2 in the expected output), but all other specifics about test cases, annexes, identifiers, and TSS structure are present and accurate."

However, it omits some details: it does not mention the context of 'Table A.7', does not explicitly mention the size of the RunID field as 8 bytes, or the exact name of timers like TT_match_session and TT_EVSE_match_session, and it lacks the explicit detailed processing sequence (steps 13\u201316) present in the Expected Output, such as CM_SET_KEY.REQ and CM_SET_KEY.CNF.

However, it omits some subtle details, such as the precise timing relationship for delivering the request before CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF and the note about preventing missed retries, which are present in the expected output.

However, several important details are omitted or not sufficiently detailed, such as the precise calculation of ATTEN_PROFILE (including AttnRx\u2011EVSE correction), the specifics of EV_Discovering_Status thresholds and their descriptions (missing Table A.3), the EVSE's transmitter-side retry logic (TT_match_response, C_EV_match_retry), and subsequent process actions following different status outcomes.

However, it omits key Expected Output details such as: the distinction between EIM with or without Basic Charging, explicit referencing of the connection coordination sequences, and the detailed timing/control-pilot state requirements (duty-cycle specifics and state transition logic) after EIM success. The omission of the illustrative table and sequencing/OEM options from the Expected Output is a significant lack of specificity."

However, it omits/elides several key implementation details like the typical C_EV_start_atten_char_inds value (3), the precise stepwise sequence of message exchange, specifics on timing intervals (TP_EV_batch_msg_interval values, TT_EVSE_match_MNBC value), and compliance/configuration names/typical values found in Expected Output's tables and notes."

However, it omits several specifics: it does not distinguish ToggleNum being fixed to 0 in step 1 (mentions only variable in field table), does not specify the exact request/response behavior (e.g., EV behavior upon receiving each Result), omits mention of exact timer names like TT_match_sequence, misconstrues retry logic (focuses on EV retrying REQ instead of also EVSE resending CNF), skips detail about how ToggleNum is used in step 2 (e.g., comparison by EV), and does not relate to the broader matching process or flowcharts as in the expected output."

However, it omits key details such as the optional nature of the amplitude-map exchange, the description of tone mask and AMLEN/AMDATA fields, per-carrier attenuation, timing specifics (e.g., TP_amp_map_exchange), what happens on valid/invalid content, and references to specific sequence diagrams (Figure A.8).

However, it omits key EV-side behavior, does not detail primitive support specifics (Table 6 excerpt), lacks precise Control Pilot duty-cycle sub-states, transition steps (X1/X2/E/F), and misses the distinct behavior/steps for EV vs EVSE. Some timing parameters (like T_step_EF) and related primitives are omitted, so relevant technical details are missing."

It references relevant ISO 15118-3 clauses and tables. However, specific omissions include: not mentioning the Network Membership Key (NMK) reset, the explicit relationship to the HPGP standard for 'Leaving an AVLN', absence of detail about post-termination primitives (D-LINK_READY.indication, D-LINK_ERROR.request), and does not cover the importance of deterministic link abort or the context about why timely termination is needed.

It introduces key components such as EVCC and SECC, provides a layer-by-layer table, mentions the service primitive interface, and summarizes protocol references. However, it omits critical technical specifics like details of power-line communication (HomePlug Green PHY, G3-PLC), service access points, SAP types, and nuances such as session management primitives, hardware-software separation, and specific high-level V2G use cases like Plug-and-Charge. This omission of detail is significant enough to merit a moderate penalty."

However, it omits key details: it fails to mention specific V2G payload exchanges, precise SAP primitives (like D-LINK_READY.indication), the ETH SAP equivalence, and most stack interaction specifics (like Control Pilot integration and Convergence layer details). The output is accurate but omits several important implementation-specific and functional details clearly outlined in the expected output."

However, it omits critical details such as validation of the message against Table A.4 (MME definition), handling of invalid RSPs by the EVSE (they are to be ignored but do not stop the process), explicit mention of the parameters TT_EV_atten_results, TP_EV_match_session, and specific thresholds (C_EV_match_signalattn_direct/indirect) used for final matching decisions.

It omits some specific details from the expected output, such as the differentiation between unicast/broadcast for step 1/step 2, explicit enumeration of EV and EVSE side behaviors, the role of SLAC-based measurement, the definition of B-C-B toggles count (C_EV_vald_nb_toggles), and the handling of invalid content.

However, it omits or glosses over some specifics from the expected output, such as the explicit pre-sequence message CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ/RESP and the CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND message, key MME parameters, exact values and meanings of constants (like C_EV_match_MNBC), the matching criteria statuses (EVSE_FOUND, etc.), exact method for receive-path insertion loss correction, and the finer details of message parameterization and Ethernet addressing."

Some timing and constant values are less specific and there is minor confusion between message names (mixing ATTEN_PROFILE.IND and ATTEN_CHAR.IND).

However, it omits some key signal injection context details, specifics about MAC-level arbitration, restrictions on the EV responding to certain MMEs (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ), the one-device CCo exclusivity, and does not clearly mention that the CCo controls medium access per Expected Output, resulting in a loss of detail."

However, some details are omitted: it does not specifically identify CM_AMP_MAP.REQ as an MME in the HomePlug GreenPHY profile; the example of per-carrier data encoding is missing; reference to how the 4-bit values translate to attenuation steps is less explicit; the sequence chart and a concrete data payload example are omitted; nuances such as local vs. remote procedure are less clearly delineated; and some timings are slightly simplified. No factual contradiction, but some loss of precision and depth per step 2."
