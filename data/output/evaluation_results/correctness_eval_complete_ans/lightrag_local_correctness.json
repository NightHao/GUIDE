        "score": 0.624233848076848,
        "reason": "The actual output correctly describes the layered architecture (physical, data link, higher layers) and the role of ISO 15118 parts, aligning with the structure in the expected output and referencing appropriate standards. However, it omits significant technical details present in the expected output, such as explicit OSI layer mapping, detailed explanation of PLC specifications, service primitive interface, SAPs, session/presentation/application layer specifics, and key use-case examples from ISO 15118-1. The omission of these details requires a deduction, resulting in a moderately high score."

        "score": 0.43700575955657933,
        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately defines HPGP as HomePlug Green PHY used for powerline communication between EVs and EVSE, referencing ISO 15118-3, energy efficiency, and vehicle-to-grid support, in line with the Expected Output. However, it omits important technical details from the Expected Output such as the use of the 1 kHz control-pilot line, specifics of the injection method, circuit diagram elements, frequency range (1.8-30 MHz), signal parameters (voltages, capacitances, resistances), and other in-depth engineering aspects, warranting a substantial penalty for detail omission."

        "reason": "The actual output correctly defines SLAC as Signal Level Attenuation Characterization, places it within the ISO 15118-3 and HomePlug Green PHY context, and covers general purpose and key features like attenuation measurement and protocol compliance, consistent with the expected output. However, it omits critical technical details outlined in the expected output: specific message sequences (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ, CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND), process steps (e.g., parameter exchange, M-SOUNDS transmission, specific matching algorithm), timing/compliance requirements, and the explicit role of Management Message Entries. This significant omission of detailed procedures and parameters warrants a substantial penalty."

        "reason": "The Actual Output broadly covers the definition and main idea\u2014that logical networks use the same NMK for secure, segmented EV/EVSE communication as in the Expected Output. However, it omits most specific details: it does not mention the ISO clause, the layer-2 data link context, the SLAC matching handshake, message types (CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ/CNF), NID/NMK derivation, joining/leaving sequences, timing (TP_match_leave), or notifications to higher layers, all present in the Expected Output. No contradictions, but significant omissions of detailed process and parameters."

        "reason": "The actual output contains significant contradictions and omissions compared to the expected output: it defines CCo as 'Communication Controller,' while the expected output specifies 'Central Coordinator' per ISO 15118-3; omits critical details on configuration requirements (e.g., EVSE always being CCo, EV never) and HomePlug Green PHY context; lacks mention of MAC-level arbitration, unique device role, CAP3 priority, relevant primitives/services, and signal injection specifics; references standards but not the correct technical content, failing evaluation steps for detail and factual consistency."

        "reason": "The actual output generally matches the high-level distinctions between Data SAP and Data Link Control SAP from the expected output, including their layer locations and functions (data transfer vs. link management). However, it omits important specifics: no mention of EtherType/Ethernet-II class/HPGP equivalence, precise clause or primitive names like D-LINK_READY.indication, layer stack locations, specific examples of payload types, and key comparative chart details. This omission of detail, especially technical specifics and SAP operation examples, results in a substantial penalty."

It lacks discussion of the formal TTCN-3 architecture, does not mention that PTC stands for Parallel (not Protocol) Test Component, omits specific roles such as MTC's resource allocation, SUT type-specific testers, port mappings, and how PTCs are instantiated by MTC for specialized observation. Most detailed mechanisms, examples, and port interactions described in the expected output are missing."

There is no direct contradiction, but the omission of these substantial specifics results in a heavily penalized score."

The actual output's explanation is less granular, missing the structured breakdown, pre/post-conditions, distinctions between AC/DC/common domains, and the annex components, leading to a significant loss of detail."

While the core concepts\u2014EIM as external identification for EV charging per ISO 15118\u2014are correct, the lack of tables, sequence breakdowns, and technical process steps are significant omissions."

        "reason": "The Actual Output is factually aligned with the Expected Output in stating CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ is used in SLAC matching between EV and EVSE, is sent by the EV to initiate parameter exchange, and involves details such as RunID. However, it omits key details such as specific trigger events (like plug-in or wake-up triggers), exact message fields (APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE), retransmission behavior, timing parameters (TP_EV_SLAC_init, TT_match_response, etc.), the use of Ethernet broadcast, and a stepwise error handling process.

However, it omits detailed technical specifics: message field breakdowns (M-SOUND_TARGET, NUM_SOUNDS, etc.), the unicast vs. broadcast nature, precise retry/timer error-handling mechanisms, and timing constants (TT_match_response, C_EV_match_retry), all of which are thoroughly outlined in the expected output.

However, it omits essential details such as its exclusive role as an EV acknowledgment to each IND, the sequence mechanics, protocol references (Annex A, message order, timers like TT_EV_atten_results and related parameters), and error/content validation steps.
