        "reason": "The actual output covers the general V2G architecture, mentions ISO 15118, the OSI model, relevant components (EVCC, SECC), and process phases, in agreement with expected output details and with no contradictions. However, it omits key explicit details from the expected output: it does not reference ISO 15118-2 or ISO 15118-1, misses coverage of the higher OSI layers (3-7), the service primitive interface, specific PLC specs, various SAPs, and explicit mapping of the function of each ISO part. This omits important protocol separation and layer specifics that are heavily detailed in the expected output."

However, it omits critical technical details from the Expected Output such as the precise frequency range (1.8\u201330 MHz), parallel injection circuit elements (e.g., inductor, damping resistor, cable length limit, peak-to-peak voltage), precise signal requirements (PSD, crosstalk values), and lacks specific content from the detailed schematic and Table A.11. No factual contradictions, but substantial omission of core technical detail."

However, it omits almost all technical and procedural details such as the matching sequence, specific management message names (like CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ), message parameterization, numerical constants, sequence of exchanges, and evaluation/decision logic found in the expected output. It also does not clarify the exclusive relationship to HomePlug Green PHY or enumerate the involved steps and timing requirements. No contradictory facts were present. Omission of detail is severe."

However, it omits almost all specific technical details: MAC-level arbitration, role exclusivity, explicit EVSE vs. EV configuration requirements, the SLAC matching process, priority requirements, specific SAP primitives, and context on signal injection. Much detailed information from the expected output is not included, resulting in a heavy penalty for omission per the steps."

However, it omits key details such as the definition of MTC and PTC from ISO 15118-5, specific port interactions (e.g., pt_SLAC_Port, pt_HAL_61851_Port), instantiation and hierarchical control (MTC as the only top-level, PTCs created by MTC), no mention of the role and structure of verdict calculation, allocation of timers/variables, example PTCs like HAL_61851_Listener, and key technical specifics about internal vs external ports.

However, it omits critical details such as the hierarchical organization (functions, test cases, groups), specific test profile contents (PICS/PIXIT), the exact identifiers, and the breakdown/description of annexes (A-G) as outlined in the expected output. This lack of detail about TSS's structure and specifics heavily reduces the completeness per the evaluation criteria."

It lacks specifics about unicast vs. broadcast, detailed message structure/fields, retry/timing logic, error handling, and the explicit EV\u2013EVSE exchange process found in the Expected Output.

However, it omits substantial technical details such as the message flow steps, specific fields (like ATTEN_PROFILE calculations and corrections), critical timings/constants, the precise roles of participating messages (e.g., M\u2011SOUNDS, CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND), and the use of attenuation thresholds in the matching process.
