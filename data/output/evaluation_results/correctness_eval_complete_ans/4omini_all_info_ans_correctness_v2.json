        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately covers the definition, characteristics, parameter exchange, NMK and NID handling, joining and leaving processes, and timing parameters of logical networks just like the Expected Output. It includes details such as use of CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ/CNF, D-LINK_READY.indication, TP_match_leave, mentions Figures A.7 and A.9.5.3, and network segmentation at OSI layer 2. However, it omits mention of [HPGP] clauses, V2G3-A09 references, and the explicit table format for timing constants, leaving out traceability to standard references and slight detail from Expected Output."

        "score": 0.8989013057652768,
        "reason": "The actual output accurately captures the distinction between MTC and PTC, covering their creation, roles (MTC as top-level/controller, PTC as helper/observer), configuration, and port relationships \u2014 consistent with the expected output. It specifies both SECC_Tester and EVCC_Tester as MTC types, HAL_61851_Listener as a PTC, and explains port mapping (including internal port for MTC/PTC and interface ports for TSI). Very minor omission: slightly less emphasis on MTC lifeline/timer/variable detail and summary of PTC's lack thereof, but these are referenced indirectly. All main facts and required details are present and not contradicted."

        "reason": "The actual output accurately describes CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ as part of the SLAC process, outlines when and why it is sent (after determining the appropriate EVSE based on attenuation measurement), and details its structure with field names and sizes that match the expected output. EVSE handling and retransmission flows are present. However, the actual output omits explicit mention of the NMK/NID exchange purpose, lacks stepwise detail about optional BCB-validation before sending, and does not specify the join process using NMK/NID or reference standards (e.g., Table A.7, ISO 15118) as in the expected output."

It adds more detail and maintains consistency with the facts of the expected output. Only minor omissions and some rephrasing\u2014such as less explicit mention of context ('ctx') and figure/table referencing, and slightly less detail regarding library/utility functions at lowest hierarchy\u2014prevent a perfect score."

However, it omits some detailed field-level info like precise byte offsets/sizes (Table A.7), certain reserved fields, specific timing values (e.g., TT_match_session = 500ms), and the full step-by-step exchange referencing Figure A.2. The omissions are not factual contradictions but do reduce the completeness."

        "score": 0.8952574125307768,
        "reason": "The actual output closely matches the expected output in facts and detail: it describes CM_SET_KEY.REQ as a message to configure the EV/EVSE low-layer module (HomePlug Green PHY/modem) with NID and NMK, specifies context, message structure matching Table A.8, and accurately summarizes the timing and sequence (TT_match_join, matching, retry logic). Most field definitions match exactly, including octet numbers, fixed/variable values, and purposes. However, minor detail is omitted: the actual output does not emphasize this is a unicast primitive to the local modem, and does not mention some nuances like the payload being 38 octets, the precise sequence requirement 'before\u2014or at the latest after\u2014CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF', or listing all field names in the bullet format of expected output.

However, detail is omitted regarding specific retry parameters (such as C_EV_match_retry), precise numeric thresholds (like C_EV_match_signalattn_direct or indirect), explicit description of the response/retry timer on the EVSE (TT_match_response retransmission logic), and the next flow steps after CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND. These omissions prevent a perfect score despite the absence of any factual contradiction."

However, it omits precise attributions to ISO 15118-3, lacks direct reference to Table 1/branch labeling (a, b, c, d), and does not explicitly define EIM as one of two main ISO 15118-3 methods or emphasize EIM's definition as 'any user/contract authentication outside the vehicle's certificate exchange.' The control pilot timing after EIM passage is less clearly specified and key summary details (such as exact wording from [V2G3-M06-08]) are missing.

However, it omits some peripheral compliance notes (like Table A.1 reference, Figure A.1, and explicit mention of HomePlug Green PHY compliance phrase and [V2G3-A09-17]), and its description is less concise in mapping to ISO 15118-3 Annex A or referencing precise standard clauses.

However, it omits key expected details: (1) it doesn\u2019t mention that the ATS is formally defined in ISO 15118-5 and that ATS test cases verify PLC-based high level comm and Basic Signaling as the expected output specifies; (2) it does not explicitly explain the scope exclusions (performance, reliability, power flow, etc.), or the link to OSI layers and TTCN-3; (3) specific examples from PICS/PIXIT and abbreviation lists are incomplete or missing.

However, it omits some important specifics found in the expected output: explicit mention that only the ResType field is present in CM_AMP_MAP.CNF, precise size details (1 Octet), explicit statement about C_EV_match_retry for maximum retransmissions, and lacks references to specific ISO clauses (e.g., V2G3-A09-115, etc.), as well as details like the exact field structure (no list of octets or strict sizes).

It omits explicit mention of the procedure following 'Leaving an AVLN' per HomePlug Green PHY and does not explicitly state the TP_match_leave max time as 1 s, but otherwise includes virtually all expected detail without contradicting any facts."

It covers the physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers with correct roles and standards, and mentions interoperability, modularity, and implementation examples.

It correctly identifies that Data SAP handles V2G payloads for Layer 3 (e.g., IPv6) and that Data Link Control SAP manages link status and control. Associated primitives for Data Link Control SAP are all mentioned with appropriate brief descriptions, matching details from the expected output. Slight omission: the actual output does not explicitly mention the 'ETH SAP' (Ethernet-II) naming or the coverage by HomePlug Green PHY, nor does it reference the specific ISO clauses or table numbers. The comparative tabular format and some phrasing are not mirrored, but all substantive information is included."

However, several details in the expected output are either omitted or only partially covered, such as the full sequential message exchange (e.g., missing CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP and CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND details), correction for attenuation using AttnRxEVSE, explicit decision logic for EV_Discovery_Status, and references to specific flow steps and clause numbers. This omission of fine-grained process detail and intermediate step explanations means some information relevant per the evaluation steps is missing, warranting a moderate deduction in score."

It repeats the key role in logical network join and error/implementation flexibility. However, critical detail is omitted: no specific CM_SET_KEY.REQ field breakdown, no Table A.8 reference, lacks explicit payload and sequence context/timing details (like max(TT_match_join)), and omits HomePlug/ISO 15118-3 standards reference present in the expected output."

However, it omits several specific details found in the expected output: it refers to both CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND and CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND interchangeably without clarifying naming, does not mention ISO 15118-3, lacks explicit formulas (e.g., the arithmetic mean equation), does not specify parameter and timing constants (C_EV_start_atten_char_inds, C_EV_match_MNBC, TT_EV_atten_results, their typical values), nor explicitly outlines the message timing and sequence (such as the number of messages and timeouts). Also, example values for thresholds for direct/indirect matching (e.g., 10 dB, 20 dB) are not provided.

However, it omits some specific protocol standard references (e.g., HomePlug Green PHY), precise timing intervals (TP_EV_batch_msg_interval), and the explicit per-message explanation that every CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND triggers one M-Sound emission, leading to a slight loss in technical detail."
