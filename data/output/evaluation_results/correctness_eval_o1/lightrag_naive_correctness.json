        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "The Input asks for a system architecture of V2G. In the Actual Output, ISO 15118 is mentioned but crucial details like EVCC/SECC roles, AC/DC specifics, and test case references from the Expected Output are missing; no factual contradictions were noted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "No factual conflict with Expected Output, but the Actual Output omits key details (e.g., cost-effectiveness, data rates, SLAC requirements) mentioned in the Expected Output, even though it does address power-line communication and pilot line injection from the Input."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "Actual output contradicts the acronym (says \u201cSmart Load and Charge\u201d instead of \u201cSignal Level Attenuation Characterization\u201d) and omits critical details like attenuation measurement steps and HomePlug Green PHY references from the expected output."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "No direct contradictions, but the Actual Output omits key points like layer 2 scope, central coordinator management, segmentation, and leaving procedure found in the Expected Output. While the Input asks 'What is Logical Network?', the Actual Output mainly covers SLAC matching and key exchanges, missing details on membership and multi-network coexistence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "Although the 'Input' requests information on 'CCo,' the 'Actual Output' omits the in-depth details found in the 'Expected Output' (e.g., roles, network management, and implementation), reflecting a significant lack of completeness."

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "From the Input question on the difference between these SAPs, the Actual Output explains some data\u2010transfer primitives but omits critical link\u2010management details (e.g., error handling, flow control, Ethernet association) that are clearly highlighted in the Expected Output. No direct factual contradiction, yet key specifics are missing."

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between MTC and PTC?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "They do not contradict each other (both mention MTC managing test execution and PTC monitoring signals), but the Actual Output omits key details from the Expected Output, including how the MTC computes final verdicts and coordinates multiple testers, and how the PTC connects via pt_HAL_61851_Internal_Port."

        "question": "What is ATS?",
        "score": 0.4,

    {
        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "From the Input asking about TSS, the Actual Output focuses on generic testing structure and omits ISO 15118 details, grouping of test cases, and PICS/PIXIT info mentioned in the Expected Output, leading to significant missing specifics."

        "question": "What is EIM?",
        "score": 0.1,
        "reason": "For the question about EIM, the actual output defines it as 'Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Management,' contradicting the expected 'External Identification Means' in ISO 15118-1 and omitting authentication details mentioned in the expected output."

        "question": "What is CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND?",
        "score": 0.5,

        "reason": "No factual contradictions between the actual output and the expected output, but the expected mentions details like runid, application/security types, multiple transmissions (C_EV_match_MNBC), and intervals (TP_EV_batch_msg_interval) that the actual output omits. The actual output does note a count field, aligning with the expected, but it lacks other key specifics from the input."

        "question": "What is CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, it references ISO 15118 and sound attenuation, whereas the Expected Output describes SLAC context and signal attenuation from EVSE to EV. It also omits details like ATTEN_PROFILE and test scenarios, although \u2018num_sounds\u2019 is mentioned."

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, there is no mention of TT_EVSE_match_session or max retry limit (as described in Expected Output), and it states the message is sent by the Test System instead of the EV (contradicting the Input/Expected Output perspective), so important details are omitted."

        "reason": "Input asks about CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF. The Actual Output covers it as a confirmation message for a matching process, listing key fields (NID, NMK), but misses timing constraints (TT_match_response) and the strict test/certification references described in the Expected Output. It also omits the explicit Signal Level Attenuation Characterization mention and the role of EVSE as sender under defined timing."

        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, it references fields like KeyType and MyNonce from the Input but omits key points from the Expected Output (e.g., mention of MME, logical network membership, or its relationship to CM_SET_KEY.CNF), thus missing detail while not contradicting any facts."
