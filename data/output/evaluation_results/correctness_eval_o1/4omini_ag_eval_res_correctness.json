        "score": 0.9,
        "reason": "Based on the Input's focus on defining a Logical Network at Layer 2, the Actual Output aligns well with the Expected Output by detailing membership, a Central Coordinator, and error handling. However, the Actual Output omits some specifics (like NMK or MME exchanges) mentioned in the Expected Output, so it is slightly less comprehensive."
