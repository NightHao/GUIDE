        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "No contradictions with the Expected Output, but the Actual Output omits crucial details (e.g., EVCC, SECC, SessionStopReq, B1/B2 transitions) clearly outlined in the Expected Output and only briefly refers to ISO 15118 in comparison to the more extensive information in the Input."
    },

        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "No contradictions regarding HPGP for EV charging and ISO 15118, but the actual output omits several details (data rate, coupling circuit, EMC/ESD protection, SLAC/security protocols) outlined in the expected output."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.1,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, SLAC is incorrectly called 'Smart Load Adaptive Control' rather than 'Signal Level Attenuation Characterization' (Expected Output) and focuses on ISO 15118 load management while omitting critical details about measuring signal attenuation over power lines, matching procedures, and HomePlug Green PHY references."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "The Input asks what a \u2018Logical Network\u2019 is; the Actual Output addresses EV/EVSE communication but omits major layer-2, membership, and CCo details found in the Expected Output. No direct contradictions, but significant omission."
    },

        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "The Actual Output claims 'CCo' is not mentioned, but the Expected Output provides extensive details (e.g., Central Coordinator\u2019s network management role) missing from the Actual Output. The user asked 'What is CCo?', yet those specifics were not addressed."

        "question": "What is the difference between MTC and PTC?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "From the Input question, the Actual Output omits key details compared to the Expected Output (e.g., MTC\u2019s final verdict role, TTCN-3 configuration, and how PTC informs MTC about EIM authorization and signal changes). While no facts contradict, the omission of these specifics lowers the rating."

        "question": "What is ATS?",
        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "The input is about ATS. The actual output references ISO 15118 but omits details on static/dynamic conformance, table coverage (e.g., Table 27), and PICS/PIXIT mentioned in the expected output."

        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, there is no mention of ISO 15118, AC/DC charging scenarios, or PICS/PIXIT requirements that the Expected Output highlights for TSS. The Actual Output provides a generic explanation of test organization but omits key details like how tests are grouped, how the SUT is stimulated, and specific references (e.g., section 7.2)."

        "question": "What is EIM?",
        "score": 0.1,
        "reason": "The actual output defines EIM as 'Energy Management' instead of 'External Identification Means' from the expected output and omits key details about identification and authorization from Input/Expected Output, causing a direct contradiction."

        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "The Input asks about CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, and the Actual Output explains its role in SLAC without contradicting the Expected Output. However, it omits key details from the Expected Output (e.g., that the EV is the sender, timing constraints, and usage in test cases), so important information is missing."

        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "In the Input, user asks about CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND within SLAC and V2G; the Actual Output only mentions a general message with a 'count' field but omits the SLAC, RUNID, and broadcast specifics from the Expected Output. There is no direct contradiction, but critical details like repeated transmissions and security settings are missing."

        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "Contradicts Expected Output about which side sends CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND (Actual says EVCC to EVSE; Expected says EVSE to EV) and omits key fields like ATTEN_PROFILE/NUM_SOUNDS, resulting in loss of critical detail."

        "reason": "The actual output does not contradict the expected information but omits key details on timing (TT_match_response), test scenarios, and V2G3 references present in the expected output; it acknowledges the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND relationship but lacks the thorough specifics required."

        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "In the input, the question is about CM_ATTEN_PROFILE.IND, but the actual output omits several key details from the expected output (e.g., SLAC process, TT_EVSE_MATCH_MNBC timer, ignoring scenario for zero sounds, and integration with CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND).

        "reason": "Input asks about CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF, but Actual Output calls it 'Smart Logic and Control' conflicting with Expected Output's 'Signal Level Attenuation Characterization'; it also omits key timing (TT_match_response) and sender/receiver details despite Expected Output emphasizing those requirements."

        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "In the Input, the question asks about CM_SET_KEY.REQ, but in the Actual Output it only references ISO 15118 and SLAC.
