        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "No contradictions between the Actual Output\u2019s mention of EV charging and the Expected Output\u2019s details on V2G, but key specifics (ISO 15118, pilot line usage, notched carriers) from the Expected Output are omitted."

    {
        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "While it doesn\u2019t contradict the expected details about SLAC under HomePlug Green PHY, it omits significant EV charging context and the specific message exchanges (e.g., CM_SLAC_MATCH) described in the expected output. The actual output focuses on power line networking rather than the matching and attenuation measurement steps outlined."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.7,
        "reason": "The Actual Output references ISO 15118-3 and covers layer 2 segmentation plus encrypted membership (aligning with the Expected Output\u2019s focus on secure grouping at layer 2) but omits mention of the Central Coordinator (CCo) and \u2018unmatched\u2019 state management from the Expected Output, leaving out some important detail from the Input."

        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "No contradictions, but the actual output omits join/leave management details (e.g., MME usage), the typical EVSE side location (per V2G3-A06-02), and link termination points mentioned in the expected output."

        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "The input requests a comparison, but the actual output mentions only Data Link Control SAP and omits describing Data SAP. The expected output shows both are SAPs in the data link layer, each handling different functions (data transfer vs link management), which the actual output fails to cover."

        "score": 0.7,
        "reason": "For the Input\u2019s question, the Actual Output aligns with the Expected Output on key points about Basic Signaling and High-Level Communication but omits several details from the Expected Output (e.g., reference to IEC 61851-1 and advanced features like authentication), though it does not contradict any facts."

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "The Actual Output is consistent with the Input about MTC as main controller and PTC running in parallel but omits details from the Expected Output (e.g., EIM authorization monitoring, data link processing, and ports).

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "While the Actual Output correctly describes ATS for ISO 15118-3 (Input) and matches key points (capabilities, behavior tests), it omits several specifics noted in the Expected Output, such as excluded requirements (e.g., Table 27 references) and deeper test framework details."

        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.7,
        "reason": "No direct contradictions. The actual text details the TSS framework for ISO 15118-5, mentioning subgroups, module identifiers, and EVCC/SECC, but it omits reference to PICS/PIXIT, section 7.2, and specific annexes noted in the expected text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is EIM?",
        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "Input asks about EIM; Actual Output correctly ties it to ISO 15118 and authorization, matching Expected Output's main facts. However, it omits details like AC/DC usage and how it can run alongside Plug and Charge mentioned in the Expected Output."

        "score": 0.7,
        "reason": "In the Input, the question concerns CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ. The Actual Output provides partial details about runID, EV/EVSE MAC addresses, and timing but omits key information found in the Expected Output (e.g., triggers like TT_EVSE_match_session, the applicationType parameter, and retry limits) even though it does not contradict it."

        "score": 0.7,
        "reason": "The Actual Output aligns with timing and parameter requirements from the Input and Expected Output (e.g., TT_match_response, runID, MACs) but omits key details like typically being sent from the EVSE to the EV and ignoring invalid CNF messages. No factual contradictions, yet some Expected Output specifics are missing."

        "question": "What is CM_SET_KEY.CNF?",
        "score": 0.9,
        "reason": "Actual Output closely matches Expected Output by describing the confirmation of network parameters post-CM_SET_KEY.REQ. No contradictory facts, but the Actual Output emphasizes configuration can occur anytime before CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF (Input mentions this), whereas Expected Output describes usage after receiving CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF."
