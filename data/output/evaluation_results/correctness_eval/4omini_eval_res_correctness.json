        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "Although the actual output cites ISO 15118-3 and ISO 15118-5 from the input and covers basic V2G elements, it omits key details such as AC/DC PLC communication, SessionStopReq, and specific test references from the expected output. There are no direct factual contradictions, but several important points are missing."

        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "The input is about HPGP, and the actual output does not contradict the expected output but omits details like pilot line usage, notched carriers, and specific security features mentioned in the expected output."

    {
        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "While the Actual Output correctly states SLAC is for measuring signal strength (aligning with the Input), it omits many details (e.g., matching phases, CM_SLAC_PARM and CM_ATTEN_CHAR messages) that the Expected Output covers, resulting in less comprehensive coverage."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "No contradictions and it covers layer 2, membership, and secure data exchange per both Actual and Expected Output, but it omits the CCo\u2019s role (mentioned in Expected) and the unmatched state transition, so some detail is missing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "Although the Actual Output aligns with the Expected Output by noting that the EV side should never become CCo, it omits key details from the Expected Output\u2014such as network management functions (devices leaving) and MME usage\u2014and uses a different name (\u201cControl Communication Object\u201d vs \u201cCentral Coordinator\u201d), making it less complete."

        "reason": "From the Input (\u201cWhat is TSS?\u201d) to the Actual Output (ISO 15118-5 references, test subgroups, identifiers) there is alignment and no factual conflict with the Expected Output. However, the Actual Output omits important details mentioned in the Expected Output (e.g., section 7.2, EVCC/SECC templates, annex references)."

        "question": "What is EIM?",
        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "The Actual Output accurately references ISO 15118 and aligns with the Input\u2019s query, but it omits details from the Expected Output (e.g. AC/DC usage, 15118-1 definition, and running alongside Plug and Charge), thereby losing points for leaving out important specifics."

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "From the Input asking about CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, the Actual Output provides some correct ISO 15118 details but omits many specifics found in the Expected Output (e.g., SOURCE_ADDRESS, APPLICATION_TYPE, SECURITY_TYPE, or the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP flow). It does include partial coverage of ATTEN_PROFILE and NUM_SOUNDS, reflecting some alignment but still missing critical fields and messaging context."
