    {
        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "Although the Actual Output addresses HPGP for EV communication (aligned with the Input), it omits multiple specifics from the Expected Output\u2014such as lower data rates derived from HomePlug AV, use on the control pilot line, and references to SLAC\u2014resulting in heavy penalization for missing detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "The Actual Output contradicts the acronym (calling SLAC \u2018Smart Light AC\u2019 instead of \u2018Signal Level Attenuation Characterization\u2019) and omits key details (like attenuation measurements, matching procedures, and specific protocol messages) from the Expected Output."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "Input asks for a definition; the Actual Output focuses on EV context but omits critical layer 2 details, the CCo\u2019s role, membership visibility, and network exit steps from the Expected Output, though it doesn\u2019t contradict any facts."

        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "Though there are no contradictions with the expected outputs, the actual output omits key details regarding device departure detection, higher-layer requests for link termination, and references to V2G3-A06-02 and MME usage described in the expected output."

        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "The Input asks about ATS, but Actual Output calls it an 'Automated Testing Suite' rather than 'Abstract Test Suite' (Expected Output), omitting key details about static/dynamic conformance, partial coverage of ISO 15118-3, and references to the SUT that the Expected Output emphasizes."

    {
        "question": "What is TSS?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "From the Input asking about TSS, the Actual Output correctly identifies TSS in relation to ISO 15118 but misses many specifics found in the Expected Output (e.g., grouping by AC/DC, naming conventions, PICS/PIXIT references, and section details)."

        "question": "What is EIM?",
        "score": 0.1,
        "reason": "For the Input question about EIM, the Actual Output redefines EIM as \u201cEnergy Information Management\u201d instead of \u201cExternal Identification Means\u201d from ISO 15118-1 (Expected Output). It also omits key details mentioned in the Expected Output about AC/DC usage and pre-plug-in identification."

        "question": "What is CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "In the Actual Output, it calls CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND both an event-type and a confirmation message, which contradicts the Expected Output\u2019s emphasis on it being an indication message for SLAC usage from EVSE to EV, and it omits key fields (NUM_SOUNDS, ATTEN_PROFILE, SOURCE_ADDRESS, etc.) and details about replying with CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP."

        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "They do discuss compliance with ISO 15118 and mention 'pilotTimer,' but they contradict the expected point that the EV sends CM_VALIDATE.REQ (they say the Test System sends it) and omit key fields (like 'signalType' or 'result') as well as the resend/confirmation logic mentioned in the expected output."
