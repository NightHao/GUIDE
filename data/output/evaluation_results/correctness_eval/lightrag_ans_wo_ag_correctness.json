        "reason": "The Actual Output references ISO 15118-5 instead of ISO 15118-2, and it omits key details found in the Expected Output (e.g., AC/DC charging specifics, B1/B2 transitions, SessionStopReq messages), leading to a significant gap in mentioned architecture components and processes."

        "question": "What is HPGP?",
        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "While the Actual Output addresses HPGP\u2019s role in EV charging (from the Input) and cites ISO 15118, it omits important Expected Output details like its derivation from HomePlug AV, lower data rates, SLAC, and security features\u2014no contradictions, but notable omissions."

        "question": "What is SLAC?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "There is no factual contradiction with the expected output, but the actual output omits key details about SLAC\u2019s matching phase (e.g., CM_SLAC_MATCH.REQ/CM_SLAC_MATCH.CNF), specific message exchanges (like CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND, CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP), and testing references mentioned in the expected output."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.9,
        "reason": "No contradictions found between Actual Output and Expected Output. Actual Output addresses layer 2, membership, visibility, and leaving procedures from Input, but it omits mentioning the Central Coordinator noted in the Expected Output."

        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.5,
        "reason": "In the Input (\u201cWhat is CCo?\u201d) the Actual Output calls it a \u201cControl Communication Object\u201d under ISO 15118, matching the idea that the EV side never becomes CCo.

        "score": 0.9,
        "reason": "Mentions ISO 15118-3 context, addresses link status (D-LINK primitives), notes ETH SAP, and matches most expected details about higher-layer interfacing and control. Slightly differs from expected output on whether Data SAP sits 'above' or 'in' the data link layer."

        "question": "What is the difference between basic signaling and high-level communication?",
        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "From the Input, it addresses the difference thoroughly. The Actual Output matches the Expected Output by describing fallback, duty cycle, and advanced functions but omits references like IEC 61851-1 and V2G3-M06 details, so it is missing some specifics."

        "score": 0.8,
        "reason": "The Input\u2019s question about MTC vs. PTC is answered similarly in the Actual Output and Expected Output, referencing EIM status and parallel test components.

        "score": 0.6,
        "reason": "From the Input asking about EIM, the Actual Output cites ISO 15118-5 but not ISO 15118-1, omits AC/DC usage, and doesn\u2019t mention pre-plug-in identification or that EIM can run alongside other methods in the Expected Output. No factual contradiction, but several details are missing."
