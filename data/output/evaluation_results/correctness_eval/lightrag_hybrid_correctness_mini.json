        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "The Actual Output calls SLAC 'Smart Light AC' while the Expected Output defines it as 'Signal Level Attenuation Characterization' measuring attenuation over power lines. It also omits key details like the matching process, parameter requests, and specific message exchanges (e.g., CM_SLAC_MATCH) mentioned in the Expected Output."

        "question": "What is Logical Network?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "The actual output does not contradict the expected output but omits multiple critical details (e.g., layer 2 operation, CCo management, membership/encryption) that the expected output explicitly includes, thus partially addressing the Input question about Logical Network."

        "question": "What is CCo?",
        "score": 0.3,
        "reason": "From the Input (\u201cWhat is CCo?\u201d) and the Expected Output, the Actual Output discusses EVSE oversight but leaves out points like detecting devices leaving, link termination, MME usage, and placement on the EVSE side rather than the EV\u2014significant details missing from the Expected Output."

        "score": 0.2,
        "reason": "The Actual Output calls TSS 'Test Specification Section' yet the Expected Output defines it as 'Test Suite Structure,' and it omits details such as grouping test cases, referencing section 7.2 in ISO 15118, and mentioning PICS/PIXIT information."

        "score": 0.0,
        "reason": "In the Input, EIM is asked about, but the Actual Output labels it as Energy Information Management, contradicting the Expected Output\u2019s External Identification Means (ISO 15118). The Actual Output also omits crucial details about identification and authorization from the Expected Output, resulting in heavy penalization."

        "reason": "In the Input question, it involves SLAC-based broadcast signals, but the Actual Output describes it mainly as 'sound notifications' and omits repeated transmission details, runID usage, and attenuation measurement.
