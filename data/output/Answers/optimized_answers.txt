### Key Features of D-LINK_ERROR.request:


### 1. **Purpose**
The primary function of the D-LINK_ERROR.request is to instruct the lower layers of the communication protocol to terminate the current data link and initiate a restart of the matching process. This is essential for re-establishing a reliable communication link after an error has been detected.


### 2. **Origin**
The D-LINK_ERROR.request is sent from the **High-Level Entity (HLE)**, which is responsible for managing higher-level communication tasks and error handling. The HLE detects communication errors and sends this request to the EVSE's communication node.


### 3. **State Transition**
Upon receiving the D-LINK_ERROR.request, the communication node typically operates in the **X2 state**, which triggers a series of state transitions necessary for handling the error. This transition is part of the protocol's error management process, ensuring that the system can recover from communication failures.


### 4. **Control Pilot Transition**
The D-LINK_ERROR.request involves a control pilot transition, which is a signaling mechanism used in EVSEs to control and monitor the charging process. This transition is critical for managing the restart of the data link and ensuring that the communication parameters are correctly aligned.


### 5. **Protocol Compliance**
The handling of the D-LINK_ERROR.request is defined within various protocols, including the **V2G3-M07-13**, **V2G3-M07-14**, and **V2G3-M07-16** standards. These protocols outline the requirements and procedures for managing communication errors and state transitions in vehicle-to-grid communication.


### 6. **Error Indication**
The D-LINK_ERROR.request serves as a protocol primitive that indicates a communication error in the data link layer. It prompts the receiving node to take specific actions to address the error, such as terminating the current session and attempting to re-establish a connection.


### 7. **Impact on Communication**
The receipt of a D-LINK_ERROR.request leads the EV's communication node to keep the current state, leave the logical network, and change the matching state to 'unmatched'. This indicates that the system is no longer in a valid communication state and must undergo the matching process again to re-establish a connection.

In summary, the D-LINK_ERROR.request is a critical component in the error management and communication processes of electric vehicle charging systems, ensuring that communication errors are effectively handled and that reliable connections can be re-established between electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Question: What is CM_AMP_MAP.REQ?

Answer: CM_AMP_MAP.REQ is a command used in a communication system to facilitate the exchange of amplitude map data between two hosts through a low-layer communication module. This command is part of the CM_AMP_MAP entity, which is designed to map transmission power values for various carriers based on a reference value of −50 dBm/Hz.

### Key Functions of CM_AMP_MAP.REQ:


### 1. **Transmission Power Request**
The CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command is sent from one host to another to request the transmission power values for specific carriers. These values are essential for the destination host to calculate its amplitude map.


### 2. **Optional Functionality**
The amplitude map exchange is an optional function that allows the requesting device to ask the counterpart low-layer communication module to reduce the transmission power for certain carriers.


### 3. **Confirmation Requirement**
Upon receiving a CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, the counterpart node is required to respond with a CM_AMP_MAP.CNF message to confirm the request. This confirmation is crucial for the successful completion of the amplitude map exchange process.


### 4. **Retransmission Mechanism**
If the low-layer communication module that sent the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ does not receive a valid CM_AMP_MAP.CNF within a specified timeout period (max(TT_match_response)), it will retransmit the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ. The retransmission process includes restarting the timer and is limited to a maximum number of retries (C_EV_match_retry). If valid confirmation is not received after these retries, the matching process is deemed to have failed.


### 5. **Handling Retransmissions**
If the requested node receives another CM_AMP_MAP.REQ, it indicates that the counterpart station is retransmitting its request, possibly due to the previous CM_AMP_MAP.CNF not being received. In this case, the requested node is expected to respond to the request again.

### Contextual Importance:
The CM_AMP_MAP.REQ command plays a critical role in ensuring that both communicating hosts have accurate and synchronized amplitude map data, which is vital for effective signal processing and communication performance. The use of AMDATA fields within the CM_AMP_MAP.REQ message allows for precise representation of amplitude information for each carrier, with specific resolution values that aid in the calculation of transmission power adjustments. 

In summary, CM_AMP_MAP.REQ is a fundamental command in the amplitude map exchange process, enabling communication between hosts regarding transmission power values while ensuring reliability through confirmation and retransmission mechanisms.
