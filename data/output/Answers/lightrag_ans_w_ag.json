    "What is D-LINK_TERMINATE.request?": "D-LINK_TERMINATE.request is a primitive used by Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) to initiate the termination of a data link. This request is directed towards the lower layers of the communication protocol stack, instructing them to end the current data link. \n\nWhen the EVSE receives a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request from the Higher Layer Entity (HLE), it triggers a series of actions within the communication node. Specifically, the communication node is required to exit the logical network during a process referred to as TP_match_leave. Following this, all parameters associated with the current data link are reset to their default values, and the status of the link is updated to \"Unmatched.\" This indicates that the link is no longer active and prepares the system for potential new connections or matching processes.\n\nIn summary, D-LINK_TERMINATE.request serves as a critical command within the EVSE framework, facilitating the orderly termination of data links and ensuring that the system can efficiently manage its communication states and parameters.",
    "What is D-LINK_ERROR.request?": "D-LINK_ERROR.request is a communication primitive utilized in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, specifically between the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and the electric vehicle (EV). It serves as a critical mechanism for managing communication loss situations that may arise during the operation of the data link established for charging and validation processes.\n\n### Key Features of D-LINK_ERROR.request:\n\n\n### 1. **Purpose**\nThe primary function of D-LINK_ERROR.request is to signal a detected loss of the data link between the EV and the EVSE. This loss can occur after the establishment of a data link, necessitating a response to ensure continued communication and proper functioning of the charging process.\n\n\n### 2. **Initiation**\nThe request is sent by a higher layer entity known as the Higher Level Entity (HLE). HLE oversees the communication process and is responsible for managing error requests and state transitions. When HLE detects a communication issue, it issues a D-LINK_ERROR.request to prompt corrective actions.\n\n\n### 3. **Action Requested**\nUpon receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request, the lower layers of the communication stack are instructed to terminate the current data link. This termination is essential to reset the communication state and prepare for a potential reconnection.\n\n\n### 4. **State Transition**\nThe D-LINK_ERROR.request triggers a change in the state of the EV\u2019s communication node. Specifically, the EV will maintain its current state but will transition the matching state to 'unmatched'. This indicates that the EV is no longer in a valid communication state with the EVSE.\n\n\n### 5. **Restarting the Matching Process**\nFollowing the termination of the data link, the D-LINK_ERROR.request also requests the lower layers to restart the matching process. This is crucial for re-establishing a valid communication link and ensuring that the charging process can continue effectively.\n\n\n### 6. **Implementation by EVSE**\nThe EVSE's communication node is required to respond to the D-LINK_ERROR.request by implementing one of two specified options, which are not detailed in the provided information but are part of the protocol for handling such requests.\n\n\n### 7. **Relation to Other Primitives**\nThe D-LINK_ERROR.request is part of a broader set of communication primitives that include D-LINK_READY.indication, which informs both the EV and EVSE about the status of the communication link, indicating whether the data link setup was successful or failed.\n\nIn summary, D-LINK_ERROR.request is a vital component of the communication protocol between EVs and EVSEs, designed to manage and rectify communication losses, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure.",
