This action ensures that both devices are aware that the data link is no longer active, allowing them to reset their states and prepare for future interactions.

In summary, the D-LINK_TERMINATE.request is a crucial component of the communication protocol defined in ISO 15118-3, facilitating the orderly termination of data links between electric vehicles and charging stations.

Question: What is D-LINK_ERROR.request?

Answer: The **D-LINK_ERROR.request** is a primitive defined in the context of the ISO 15118-3 standard, which pertains to the communication interface between road vehicles and grid systems, specifically focusing on the physical and data link layer requirements. This primitive is utilized within the data link control layer to manage communication errors that may occur during the operation of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communication process.

### Key Details about D-LINK_ERROR.request:

1. **Purpose**: The primary function of the D-LINK_ERROR.request is to signal lower layers of the communication stack to terminate the current data link. This is typically invoked when an error is detected that necessitates a reset or re-establishment of the communication link.

2. **Triggering Conditions**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is triggered in scenarios where there is a loss of communication or when an error is detected in the data link. For instance, if the communication node of the electric vehicle (EV) receives this request, it indicates that the current state should be maintained while the logical network is exited, and the matching state should be changed to "unmatched."

3. **Implementation**: Upon receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request, the communication node (either in the EV or the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)) is expected to handle the error appropriately. This may involve transitioning to a state where the link is no longer considered established, and the system may need to initiate a new matching process or re-establish the data link.

4. **Relation to Other Primitives**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is part of a broader set of primitives that manage the state and status of the communication link. For example, it is related to the D-LINK_READY.indication, which informs higher layers about the status of the communication link, whether it is established or lost.

5. **Standard Reference**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is documented in the ISO 15118-3 standard, specifically under the section that deals with Layer 2 interfaces and data link control. This standard outlines the requirements and behaviors expected from the communication protocols used in vehicle-to-grid interactions.

### Summary
In summary, the D-LINK_ERROR.request is a critical component of the ISO 15118-3 standard that facilitates error handling in vehicle-to-grid communication. It allows for the termination of a faulty data link and ensures that the system can respond appropriately to communication issues, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the V2G interface.

Question: What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?

Answer: The **D-LINK_PAUSE.request** is a primitive defined in the context of the ISO 15118-3 standard, which pertains to the communication interface between road vehicles and the grid (Vehicle to Grid, or V2G). This request is part of the data link control layer and is used to manage the power-saving modes of the communication link between the Electric Vehicle (EV) and the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).

### Key Details about D-LINK_PAUSE.request:

1. **Purpose**: The primary function of the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is to instruct the lower layers of the communication stack to enter a power-saving mode. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where the EV or EVSE does not need to maintain an active communication link, thereby conserving energy.

2. **State Management**: When the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is received, the system transitions to a state referred to as "Matched." This indicates that while the communication link is paused, the system retains the necessary state information to resume communication when needed.

3. **Implementation**: According to the standard, upon receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, the EVSE is expected to switch to a control pilot state (specifically state X1) and may also switch its low-layer communication module into a low-power mode. This helps in reducing power consumption during periods of inactivity.

4. **Logical Network Parameters**: The logical network parameters are stored during the pause, ensuring that the data link can be re-established seamlessly after the pause period. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the communication process and ensuring a smooth transition back to active communication.

5. **Contextual Use**: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is part of a broader set of primitives that manage the communication link's status and transitions, including other requests like D-LINK_ERROR.request and D-LINK_TERMINATE.request, which handle error conditions and termination of the link, respectively.

### Summary
In summary, the D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a critical component of the ISO 15118-3 standard that facilitates energy efficiency in vehicle-to-grid communications by allowing the system to enter a low-power state while maintaining the necessary information to quickly resume normal operations when required. This functionality is essential for optimizing the performance and energy consumption of electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure.
