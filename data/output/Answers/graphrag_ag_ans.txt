### 6. **Network Departure**
When the low-layer communication module leaves the logical network, it will inform the HLE through a D-LINK_READY.indication with a 'no link' status, indicating that the link is no longer active.

Overall, the D-LINK_READY.indication plays a critical role in maintaining the communication link's integrity and ensuring that higher layers are continuously updated about the link's status.

Question: What is D-LINK_TERMINATE.request?

Answer: The D-LINK_TERMINATE.request is a message sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to request the termination of a data link. This request is directed towards the lower layers of a communication system, instructing them to terminate the existing data link. Upon receiving a D-LINK_TERMINATE.request, the communication node is required to leave the logical network within a specified time frame, referred to as TP_match_leave. Additionally, all parameters associated with the current link must be reset to their default values, and the status of the link should be changed to 'Unmatched'. This process effectively disconnects the communication node from the network and prepares it for potential future connections.

Question: What is D-LINK_ERROR.request?

Answer: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is a message sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to manage issues related to the data link in a communication system. Its primary function is to instruct the lower layers to terminate the existing data link and restart the matching process. This is typically done through a control pilot transition to a specific state, referred to as state E.

When the D-LINK_ERROR.request is received from the HLE, the communication node of an Electric Vehicle (EV) is required to maintain its current state, exit the logical network, and change its matching state to 'unmatched'. This process is crucial for handling the loss of communication after a data link has been established, ensuring that the system can recover and attempt to re-establish a proper connection.

In summary, the D-LINK_ERROR.request serves as a mechanism to address and rectify communication issues by resetting the data link and initiating a new matching process.

Question: What is D-LINK_PAUSE.request?

Answer: The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is a message sent by a higher layer entity (HLE) to request lower layers to enter a power-saving mode while maintaining the state as 'Matched'. This request is part of a communication protocol that involves transitioning to a low-power state without losing the established connection or network parameters.

Upon receiving a D-LINK_PAUSE.request, different actions are taken by the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and the Electric Vehicle (EV):

1. **For the EVSE:**
   - The EVSE switches to control pilot state X1.
   - It may switch its low-layer communication module into a low-power mode.
   - The logical network parameter set is stored to ensure continuity of the data link after the sleeping phase.

2. **For the EV:**
   - The EV changes to control pilot state Bx.
   - Unpowering the low-layer communication module is optional for the EV.
   - Similar to the EVSE, the EV stores the logical network parameter set for resuming the data link after the sleeping phase.

The D-LINK_PAUSE.request is designed to facilitate energy efficiency by allowing components to enter a low-power state while preserving the necessary parameters to quickly resume full communication when needed.
