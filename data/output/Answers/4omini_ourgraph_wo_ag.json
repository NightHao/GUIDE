This process may be repeated up to a maximum number of retries defined by `C_EV_match_retry`.\n\nIn summary, the CM_AMP_MAP.CNF message is a crucial part of the communication protocol that ensures the successful execution of requests related to the amplitude map exchange, facilitating effective communication between electric vehicles and charging stations.",
    "What is D-LINK_READY.indication?": "**D-LINK_READY.indication** is a communication primitive defined in the ISO 15118-3 standard, which is part of the international standards for vehicle-to-grid communication interfaces. This indication serves a critical role in the data link control layer of the communication protocol between electric vehicles (EVs) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).\n\n### Key Features of D-LINK_READY.indication:\n\n1. **Purpose**: \n   - The primary function of the D-LINK_READY.indication is to inform higher layers of the communication stack about changes in the status of the communication link. This includes notifying whether a link has been established or lost.\n\n2. **Link Status Notification**:\n   - The D-LINK_READY.indication is triggered by any change in the communication link status. It can indicate two main states:\n     - **Link Established**: This indicates that a successful data link setup has occurred, allowing for communication between the EV and EVSE.\n     - **No Link**: This indicates that the communication link has been lost, prompting higher layers to take appropriate actions, such as attempting to re-establish the link or notifying the user of the disconnection.\n\n3. **Indication Triggering**:\n   - The indication is sent whenever there is a transition from one state to another in the communication process. For example, if the system transitions from a \"Matching\" state to a \"Matched\" state, it triggers the D-LINK_READY.indication to confirm the successful establishment of the link.\n\n4. **Entities Involved**:\n   - The D-LINK_READY.indication is relevant to both the EV and EVSE, as both entities need to be aware of the link status to manage their communication effectively.\n\n5. **Implementation Context**:\n   - This indication is part of the data link control service access point (SAP) to layer 3 communication, which is crucial for ensuring that the higher layers of the communication protocol can function correctly based on the current link status.\n\n6. **Relation to Other Primitives**:\n   - The D-LINK_READY.indication is part of a broader set of primitives that manage the data link layer, including requests to terminate the link (D-LINK_TERMINATE.request) or to pause communication (D-LINK_PAUSE.request).

It is essential for managing the state of the communication link and ensuring that both the EV and EVSE can effectively communicate and respond to changes in their operational status.\n\n- This request is typically sent from the higher layers of the communication stack (such as the application layer) to the lower layers (data link layer) to manage the communication state effectively.\n\n### Related Primitives:\n- The D-LINK_TERMINATE.request is one of several primitives that manage the data link control, including others like D-LINK_READY.indication, which informs higher layers about the status of the communication link, and D-LINK_ERROR.request, which handles error conditions and may also lead to a termination of the link.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, the **D-LINK_TERMINATE.request** is a critical component of the ISO 15118-3 standard, enabling the controlled termination of communication links between electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. It plays a vital role in ensuring that communication sessions are properly managed, allowing for seamless transitions between different states of operation within the vehicle-to-grid communication framework.",
    "What is D-LINK_ERROR.request?": "**D-LINK_ERROR.request** is a communication primitive defined in the ISO 15118-3 standard, specifically within the context of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communication interface for electric vehicles. This request is utilized to manage the data link layer of communication between electric vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). Here are the key details regarding D-LINK_ERROR.request:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The primary function of the D-LINK_ERROR.request is to signal lower layers of the communication stack to terminate the current data link. This action is typically initiated when there is an error or issue detected in the communication process, necessitating a restart of the matching process.\n\n2. **Triggering Condition**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is invoked when the communication node (either the EV or EVSE) encounters a situation that requires the data link to be reset. This could occur due to various reasons, such as loss of communication or failure to establish a stable link.\n\n3. **State Transition**: Upon receiving a D-LINK_ERROR.request, the communication node is expected to maintain its current state while transitioning to a state where it can attempt to re-establish the link. Specifically, it may change the matching state to \"unmatched,\" indicating that the current matching process has failed and a new attempt will be made.\n\n4. **Higher Layer Notification**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is part of a broader error handling mechanism within the communication protocol. When this request is issued, it informs higher layers of the communication stack about the need to terminate the current link and potentially initiate a new matching process.\n\n5. **Implementation**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is defined in the context of the data link control service access point (SAP) to layer 3, which is responsible for managing the communication link's status and ensuring that the higher layers are appropriately notified of any changes in link status.\n\n6. **Related Primitives**: The D-LINK_ERROR.request is part of a suite of primitives that manage the data link layer, including D-LINK_READY.indication, which informs higher layers about the status of the communication link, and other primitives that handle link establishment and termination.\n\nIn summary, D-LINK_ERROR.request is a critical component of the ISO 15118-3 standard, facilitating error handling and communication link management in electric vehicle charging systems.
