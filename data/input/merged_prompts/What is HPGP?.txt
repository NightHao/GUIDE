---

### 1. Entities Overview

1. **EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)**  
   The left rectangular region represents the EVSE side. It provides the ¬±12‚ÄØV, 1‚ÄØkHz control pilot signal, measures voltage on the pilot line, injects and receives PLC (Power Line Communication) signals via a Green PHY modem, and references Earth (ground).

2. **EV (Electric Vehicle)**  
   The right rectangular region is the EV side. It also includes a Green PHY modem and supporting components for parallel injection and measurement of the control pilot signal (duty cycle and frequency). The EV‚Äôs contactors and internal circuitry ultimately use the pilot to detect charging states and enable communication.

3. **Oscillator ¬±12‚ÄØV, 1‚ÄØkHz (Key #2)**  
   Generates the low-frequency (1‚ÄØkHz) PWM control pilot signal. This signal is crucial for basic control pilot functions prescribed by IEC‚ÄØ61851 (e.g., indicating EV readiness or maximum current availability).

4. **Pilot Contact (Key #3)**  
   The pilot contact is effectively the point where the EVSE‚Äôs control pilot line is physically connected to the corresponding pilot input on the EV side (through the charging cable and coupler).

5. **R1 1‚ÄØk (on EVSE side)**  
   A series resistor (1‚ÄØkŒ©) connected to the oscillator output. It helps set the correct pilot voltage levels and limits current.

6. **C_S (on EVSE side)**  
   Often called the ‚Äúcontrol pilot capacitor‚Äù in IEC‚ÄØstandards. It shapes the pilot signal to comply with specific requirements and influences the total capacitive behavior on the pilot line.

7. **Green PHY Modems (Key #5)**  
   Both the EVSE and EV sides include a Green PHY modem. These modems handle high-frequency HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) communication on top of the pilot line. Each modem is shown in a dashed box on both sides (the rectangle labeled ‚Äú5‚Äù).

8. **R_damp (Damping Resistor) and L (Inductor)**  
   Each side has an R_damp and L in series, forming part of the low-pass filter for the pilot signal (the LC network) and a high-pass path for the HomePlug Green PHY signals. R_damp prevents or limits resonance in the LC filter.

9. **C_PLC (Coupling Capacitors to the Green PHY Modem)**  
   These capacitors provide a high-frequency coupling path for the Green PHY signals from the pilot line into the modem, while isolating low-frequency or DC components.

10. **C_v (EV side)**  
   Defined in IEC documents, C_v is another capacitor related to the detection/measuring circuit inside the EV, usually affecting pilot line diagnostics or measurements.

11. **R2, R3, and S2 (EV side)**  
   ‚Äî **R2 and R3**: Resistors on the EV side pilot circuitry, used for pilot line detection, current sensing, or dividing voltages for pilot sensing.  
   ‚Äî **S2**: A switch (or contact) that can open/close for pilot line control or internal EV states.

12. **Voltage Measurement (Key #1)**  
   Indicates that the EVSE side monitors pilot voltage levels for compliance with control pilot specifications (e.g., states A, B, C in IEC‚ÄØ61851).

13. **Earth (ground) (Key #4)**  
   The reference earth or protective earth (PE). The high-frequency signal is injected between the pilot line and earth/ground. This ensures the HomePlug Green PHY signals have a proper return path.

14. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (Key #6)**  
   On the EV side, the duty cycle and frequency measurement block monitors the PWM characteristics of the pilot signal (i.e., the 1‚ÄØkHz, ¬±12‚ÄØV waveform) to interpret the EVSE‚Äôs indication of available current and other pilot states.

15. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   Shown as a dashed region, these might include filters, ESD protection, or EMC compliance parts. They should not degrade the HomePlug Green PHY signals beyond stated limits.

### 2. Step-by-Step Signal Flow and Connections

Even though this is a circuit schematic rather than a traditional flowchart, we can describe how signals traverse or how each function occurs in succession:

1. **Pilot Signal Generation (EVSE side)**  
   - The **oscillator (¬±12‚ÄØV, 1‚ÄØkHz)** produces the control pilot waveform.  
   - The pilot waveform goes through **R1 (1‚ÄØkŒ©)** and **C_S**, shaping the signal and ensuring correct amplitude as per IEC requirements.

2. **Pilot Line Connection to Green PHY Modem (EVSE side)**  
   - The **pilot line** is also branched through the **LC filter** formed by **L** (inductor) and **R_damp** (damping resistor) to the **C_PLC** capacitor.  
   - **C_PLC** feeds the **Green PHY modem**, allowing high-frequency components (the HPGP signal) to pass to/from the modem but blocking the lower-frequency 1‚ÄØkHz pilot wave from saturating the modem.

3. **Voltage Measurement (EVSE side)**  
   - The EVSE monitors the pilot voltage (labeled Key #1) to verify pilot states, detect EV presence, and measure any duty cycle references required by the standard.

4. **Pilot Contact (Connector) Between EVSE and EV (Key #3)**  
   - The pilot line physically transitions from the EVSE circuit to the EV circuit at the **pilot contact**. This is typically inside the charging cable and coupler.

5. **Green PHY Parallel Injection Path to Earth (EV Side)**  
   - On reaching the EV side, the pilot line splits:  
     - One path continues into the EV‚Äôs measurement and pilot control logic (through R3, R2, and possibly S2).  
     - Another path branches through another LC filter stage (**L**, **R_damp**, **C_PLC**) to the **Green PHY modem** on the EV side. The parallel injection is again between the pilot line and **earth/ground**.  
   - The diode shown in the pilot line (on the EV side) can be part of the standard pilot detection or protective circuitry.

6. **Duty Cycle and Frequency Measurement (EV side, Key #6)**  
   - The EV needs to interpret the EVSE‚Äôs PWM signal to understand the available current or states (A, B, C, etc.). Thus, there is a block that directly measures the pilot‚Äôs duty cycle and frequency once it has passed through the EV‚Äôs front-end components.

7. **S2 (EV side switch)**  
   - **S2** may engage or disengage certain parts of the EV‚Äôs pilot circuitry, depending on the EV‚Äôs state (e.g., if the EV is ready to charge or certain fault conditions). When closed, the pilot circuit is fully connected; when open, the pilot circuit is interrupted.

8. **Additional Components for PLC Coupling**  
   - Finally, any **additional PLC coupling** components (EMC filters, ESD protection, etc.) are placed so they do not adversely affect the high-frequency Green PHY signals or the low-frequency pilot signal. They must maintain compliance with the emission and immunity constraints (A.10 EMC requirements and others cited in ISO‚ÄØ15118-3).

### 3. Relationship and Purpose of Each Section

- **Low-Frequency Pilot Signal Path (1‚ÄØkHz)**  
  Passes through R1, C_S, the pilot contact, R2, R3, and S2 (when closed). The EVSE and EV measure this pilot for verifying connection status, charging states, and maximum current availability.

- **High-Frequency Communication Path (HomePlug Green PHY)**  
  Injected in parallel to earth at both the EVSE and EV sides via the LC filters (L, R_damp, and C_PLC). These filters isolate the 1‚ÄØkHz pilot wave from the modem but allow the higher-frequency data signals to travel between the two Green PHY modems.

- **Filtering and EMC Considerations**  
  Inductors, damping resistors, and capacitors create low-pass filtering for pilot signals and high-pass filtering for the PLC signals. This design ensures that high-frequency data does not overly distort the control pilot, while the pilot line remains within standard requirements (IEC‚ÄØ61851, ISO‚ÄØ15118-3, etc.).

- **Measurement Points**  
  Key #1 (voltage measurement) and Key #6 (duty cycle/frequency measurement) denote where the EVSE and EV measure the pilot signal. In each case, there may be a low-pass filter recommended to remove the high-frequency components from the measurement path (per the notes in ISO‚ÄØ15118-3).

### 4. Summary

Figure‚ÄØA.10 demonstrates an example implementation of ‚Äúparallel injection‚Äù for HomePlug Green PHY signals onto the control pilot line:

- The **EVSE** supplies the main pilot signal via an oscillator and monitors pilot voltage.  
- **Parallel injection** ensures both the EVSE and EV couple the high-frequency Green PHY signals between the pilot and ground.  
- **Low-pass + high-pass filtering** (with L, R_damp, and capacitors) allows the 1‚ÄØkHz pilot control signal to pass unimpeded while at the same time guiding the high-frequency Green PHY data to each modem.  
- **Duty-cycle/frequency measurements** are taken by both sides (the EVSE monitors the raw pilot voltage; the EV monitors duty cycle) while the high-frequency data is superimposed.  

Through these components and connections, the system meets the dual requirements of standard pilot signaling (for charging states) and HomePlug Green PHY communication (for vehicle-to-grid data exchange) on the same control pilot conductor.
