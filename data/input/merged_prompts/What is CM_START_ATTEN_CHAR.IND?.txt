# Detailed Description of Figure A.9 — Example of Sequence Chart of Matching Process Error Handling

Below is a step-by-step explanation, in **Markdown** format, of the sequence chart labeled **Figure A.9**. This figure illustrates the **SLAC (Signal-Level Attenuation Characterization) matching process** between an Electric Vehicle (EV) and an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), with emphasis on how errors and timing constraints are handled. The diagram shows four main entities:

1. **EV Host**  
2. **EV PLC node** (the EV’s low-layer communication module)  
3. **EVSE PLC node** (the EVSE’s low-layer communication module)  
4. **EVSE Host**

Various **timers** and **messages** govern the retry logic, confirmations, and triggering conditions. The goal is to establish a matched communication link (sometimes referred to as SLAC matching). This specific figure highlights an error-handling example where the EV repeatedly sends parameter requests until the EVSE’s low-layer module is fully ready.

---

## 1. Entities and Their Roles

1. **EV Host**  
   - Coordinates overall EV-side communication and initiates the SLAC matching sequence upon detecting plug-in or other triggers.  
   - Waits for “Matching Process Start Trigger” to begin SLAC parameter exchange.

2. **EV PLC Node**  
   - The EV’s low-layer communication module that actually sends and receives SLAC messages (e.g., CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ).  
   - Interacts with the EVSE’s PLC node to configure parameters, confirm matching status, and finalize the SLAC link.

3. **EVSE PLC Node**  
   - The EVSE’s low-layer communication module. It responds to requests from the EV PLC node and eventually sends a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF message when ready.  
   - May be initially “asleep” or in a booting state, causing the EV to resend parameter requests if no confirmation is received.

4. **EVSE Host**  
   - Oversees the EVSE side, can send key-setting commands to the EVSE PLC node (CM_SET_KEY.REQ) and receives confirmations (CM_SET_KEY.CNF).  
   - Also waits internally for the “Matching Process Start Trigger” before instructing the low-layer module to proceed with matching.

---

## 2. Key Messages in the Chart

- **CM_SET_KEY.REQ** / **CM_SET_KEY.CNF**  
  Used by the EVSE Host to set cryptographic or network keys in the EVSE PLC module. A request/confirmation exchange (REQ/CNF) ensures keys are established before proceeding.

- **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ**  
  A crucial request message sent by the EV PLC node. It initiates or retries the SLAC parameter negotiation. Several of these may be sent if the EVSE PLC node is not yet ready to respond.

- **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  
  The confirmation message that the EVSE PLC node sends in response to a valid CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ. Once this is received by the EV PLC node, the matching process can progress to the next stage (or conclude if final parameters are agreed).

---

## 3. Timers and Their Significance

The figure shows multiple timers or time parameters in the margin. Each timer serves a distinct purpose in error handling and retry logic during matching:

- **TP_EV_SLAC_init**:  
  A time parameter on the EV side. Indicates when the EV is ready to start sending SLAC messages after plug-in or initialization.

- **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**:  
  A similar timeout event on the EVSE side, signifying the EVSE’s readiness for the matching process (or that it is still booting).

- **TT_match_response** and **TP_match_response**:  
  Both appear repeatedly in the message sequence. They govern how long each side waits for a response to SLAC messages (e.g., how long the EV will await a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF before resending a CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ).  
  - “TT_match_response” often indicates a test timeout or internal handling.  
  - “TP_match_response” can denote a performance or protocol timer requiring the message to be answered within a specific duration.

- **TT_matching_rate**:  
  A wait time before restarting the SLAC matching process after a failure or no-response scenario. Used to avoid flooding the network with frequent retry attempts.

- **TT_matching_repetition**:  
  The maximum duration or repetition window during which multiple matching attempts can be retried before concluding that matching has failed entirely.

- **TT_match_sequence** / **TP_match_sequence**:  
  These timers define or bound the overall sequence of matching attempts. “TT_match_sequence” may mark the final stage of the matching process or the cutoff for the entire exchange sequence.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Flow of the Sequence Chart

### A. Initial Key-Setting on the EVSE Side

1. **EVSE Host → EVSE PLC node: CM_SET_KEY.REQ**  
   - The EVSE Host sends a request to configure or set security/network keys on the EVSE PLC node.

2. **EVSE PLC node → EVSE Host: CM_SET_KEY.CNF**  
   - The EVSE PLC node confirms successful key setting back to the EVSE Host.  
   - After this step, the EVSE side is (or soon will be) ready to exchange SLAC parameters, once the matching trigger event starts.

### B. Waiting for Matching Process Start

3. **EV Host**: “Wait for Matching Process Start Trigger”  
   - On the EV side, the system is idle until the matching process is triggered (e.g., plug-in detected or higher-layer instruction).

4. **EVSE Host**: “Wait for Matching Process Start Trigger”  
   - Similarly, the EVSE Host is also waiting for the condition to begin the SLAC matching process.

5. **TP_EV_SLAC_init** and **TT_EVSE_SLAC_init**  
   - These timers are activated (or at least monitored) to ensure both sides begin matching in a timely manner.  
   - “TP_EV_SLAC_init” is often started on the EV side, while “TT_EVSE_SLAC_init” is tracked on the EVSE side.

### C. Repeated SLAC Parameter Requests and Error Handling

6. **EV PLC node → EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Attempt 1)  
   - As soon as the EV is ready, it sends the first parameter request to the EVSE.  
   - If the EVSE PLC node is not fully operational yet, no immediate response is given.

7. **Timer Trigger: TT_match_response** or **TP_match_response**  
   - The EV waits for a response from the EVSE PLC node within a defined time.  
   - If no **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** is received, the EV concludes the EVSE is not ready and may resend the request.

8. **EV PLC node → EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Attempt 2, 3, …)  
   - The EV PLC node continues sending CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ at intervals governed by **TT_match_response** (or **TP_match_response**).  
   - Each attempt is followed by another wait period.  
   - If the EVSE PLC node remains unresponsive, the timer **TT_matching_rate** might also come into play to delay the next retry.

9. **TT_matching_repetition**  
   - This overarching timer is running in the background. It ensures the total number of attempts remains within a certain window.  
   - If the EV times out on repeated attempts (and **TT_matching_repetition** expires), the process transitions to a “failed” state.

10. **EV PLC node → EVSE PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** (Final Attempt)  
    - Eventually, the EVSE PLC node is ready (i.e., has finished booting or is fully awake).

11. **EVSE PLC node → EV PLC node: CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**  
    - At long last, the EVSE responds with the confirmation message.  
    - Reception of **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** indicates that the EVSE PLC node has accepted the request parameters and has effectively “caught up” to the EV’s repeated attempts.

### D. Conclusion of Matching Sequence

12. **TP_match_sequence** and **TT_match_sequence**  
    - As soon as the correct confirmation is received, the final matching sequence timers are observed.  
    - Typically, this implies the SLAC parameter exchange has succeeded, or at least the matching process can progress to the next step in the standard (e.g., amplitude map exchange or final link readiness).

13. **Matched State**  
    - Once a valid exchange has completed, the link enters the “Matched” state (per the standard’s definitions).  
    - At this point, no further **CM_SLAC_PARM** messages should be sent (per [V2G3-A09-118]) unless the process fails or restarts.

---

## 5. Relationships and Connections

1. **Key Setting First, Then SLAC Matching**  
   - The EVSE Host sets up keys on the EVSE PLC node before the matching process triggers.  
   - This ensures that secure or correct network parameters are in place once the EV and EVSE attempt to exchange SLAC parameters.

2. **Timers Govern Retrying and Error Handling**  
   - Each **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** attempt has a corresponding timer (TT_match_response / TP_match_response). If no reply is received within that window, the EV resends.  
   - Global repetition timers **TT_matching_repetition** and **TT_matching_rate** regulate how often and how many times the EV can resend these requests before declaring failure.

3. **Confirmation Ends Parameter Repetition**  
   - Once **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF** arrives, the repeated attempts stop.  
   - The EV and EVSE effectively coordinate to finalize the link parameters.

4. **High-Level Wait States**  
   - Both the EV Host and EVSE Host remain in a “Wait for Matching Process Start Trigger” state until preconditions (like plug-in or system readiness) are met.  
   - Only after triggers and initial timers do the low-layer modules actually exchange messages.

---

## 6. Summary

Figure A.9 demonstrates a **typical SLAC matching sequence** with a strong focus on **error recovery and timing**. The EV tries multiple times to initiate the parameter exchange, while the EVSE might be booting or unready to respond. Each repeated **CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ** is gated by **TT_match_response**. If the EVSE still does not confirm, the EV eventually retries but must obey the higher-level timers (**TT_matching_rate**, **TT_matching_repetition**). Ultimately, the EVSE PLC node becomes active, responds with **CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF**, and the process can conclude successfully within **TT_match_sequence**.  

Such a design ensures robust handling of real-world delays (e.g., EVSE boot times) and aligns with ISO 15118-3 requirements that define how an “Unmatched” state eventually transitions to “Matched,” or else leads to a matching failure if all retries are exhausted.

---

> **Note:** These timers, messages, and states are specified in ISO 15118-3 Annex A for HomePlug Green PHY communication over the vehicle’s control pilot line. The standard also provides additional constraints (e.g., amplitude map exchange in A.9.6) and states that no further SLAC messages shall be processed once a “Matched” state is achieved ([V2G3-A09-118]).

## 2. Overall Structure of the Diagram

The figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):

1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑3 standard.  
2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** – Indicated by the “V2G standardized service primitive interface,” which bridges ISO 15118‑3 with the higher-layer protocols.  
3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑2 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO 15118‑1 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  

Within the big outer box labeled “Vehicle-to-Grid communication,” two standards are highlighted:
- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)
- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)

At the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.

---

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description

### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 1 Physical.”  
- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium—e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).

### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 2 Data link.”  
- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable “low-layer” communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 appear inside the “ISO 15118‑3” box. They are the core focus of “Part 3” of the ISO 15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized “pipe” for higher-layer messages.

### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface
- **Name in Diagram**: “V2G standardized service primitive interface.”  
- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO 15118‑2 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO 15118‑3.  
- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main “handshake” region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.

### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 3 Network.”  
- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).

### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 4 Transport.”  
- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO 15118‑2**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.

### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 5 Session.”  
- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO 15118‑2** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).

### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 6 Presentation.”  
- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer—handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.

### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 7 Application.”  
- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.

### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)
- **Name in Diagram**: “Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”  
- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of “V2G” communication from an OSI perspective—covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:
  1. **ISO 15118‑1** (General information and use-case definition)  
  2. **ISO 15118‑2** (Network and application protocol requirements)

  Where **ISO 15118‑1** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118‑2** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.

### 3.10 ISO 15118‑1
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑1.”  
- **Caption**: “General information and use-case definition.”  
- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (‑2 and ‑3).

### 3.11 ISO 15118‑2
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑2.”  
- **Caption**: “Network and application protocol requirements.”  
- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118‑1 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.

### 3.12 ISO 15118‑3
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑3.”  
- **Caption**: “Physical layer and Data link layer requirements.”  
- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118‑2) can function as intended.

## 4. Relationship and Connections

1. **ISO 15118‑3 → V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  
   - ISO 15118‑3 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.

2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface → ISO 15118‑2**  
   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO 15118‑2 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.

3. **ISO 15118‑2 → OSI Layers 3–7**  
   - ISO 15118‑2 “lives” across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.

4. **ISO 15118‑1 → Overall**  
   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO 15118‑1 supplies the conceptual building blocks—e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions—that shape the services needed in layers 1–7.

5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  
   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO 15118‑1 and ISO 15118‑2 is conceptually the V2G communication “stack,” reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO 15118‑3.

---

## 5. How the Diagram “Flows”
While not a classic procedural “flowchart,” the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:

1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  
2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  
3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  
4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3–7)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  

Each standard (ISO 15118‑1, ISO 15118‑2, and ISO 15118‑3) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers

- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO 15118‑3) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO 15118‑2), with ISO 15118‑1 providing conceptual underpinnings.  
- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  
- **Interoperability**: Each layer’s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor—covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.

---

**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO 15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Text 1: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.

Related Information 28: Figure A.9 gives an example of matching process error handling. The low-layer communication module of the EV is awake and the low-layer communication module of the EVSE is asleep. The EVCC sends first CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ message immediately after cable plug-in. The EVSE has to boot its low-layer communication module and is not able to answer the CM_SLAC_PARM.REQ message. After the low-layer communication module on the EVSE side is ready for communication, it sends a CM_SLAC_PARM.CNF. (sibling of Figure 1)
