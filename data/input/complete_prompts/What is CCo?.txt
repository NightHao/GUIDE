Related Information 16: The HomePlug Green PHY signals on the control pilot line are compliant with [HPGP] except the signal coupling, signal levels, and carrier usage. (sibling of Text 6)
Related Information 17: As HomePlug Green PHY signal’s coupling is directly linked to the control pilot, the schematic in [IEC-1], Annex A specification is basis for definitions regarding the control pilot signal. (sibling of Text 6)
Related Information 18: To enable HomePlug Green PHY injection, the path from EVSE’s output to EV’s input should not be considered as capacitive only as it is sufficient for the low frequency control pilot signal. For high frequency HomePlug Green PHY, the path should be considered as a transmission line. To take the high frequency into account, the control pilot circuit and the component values have to be specified in more detail. (sibling of Text 6)
Related Information 19: For the control pilot line, the additional capacity of the HomePlug Green PHY coupling circuit has to be considered. For the HomePlug Green PHY signal, the partitioning of the capacitive load of the EV, EVSE, and the charge cord is important and is detailed in this Clause. (sibling of Text 6)
