TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: 6.2.1 Basic signalling (Context: 6.2.1 Basic signalling > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - [V2G3-M06-01] The basic signalling follows [IEC-1]. All timings shall be compliant with the [IEC-1], Annex A.
Text 2: 6.2.1 Basic signalling (Context: 6.2.1 Basic signalling > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - Any charging process, no matter the presence of high-level communication, uses the bidirectional signalling according to [IEC-1], indicating EV related information through control pilot states and EVSE related information through the duty cycle of the control pilot signal.
Text 3: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - [V2G3-M06-02] The HLC shall be used in addition to the basic signalling in order to enable a bidi- rectional communication and offer additional features.
Text 4: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - The sequence of the data exchange within the HLC-based charging session is done in accordance with the [ISO-2] communication protocol.
Text 5: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - It can be split into three periods as follows:
Text 6: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - — data link setup;
Text 7: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - — V2G setup;
Text 8: 6.2.2 High-level communication (Context: 6.2.2 High-level communication > 6.2 Definition of high-level communication and basic signalling > 6 System architecture) - — V2G charging loop.
