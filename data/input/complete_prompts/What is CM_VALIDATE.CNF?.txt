# Detailed Description of Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO‑0] in the ISO/IEC OSI Reference Model

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of the diagram labeled **“Figure 1 — Overview of [ISO-0] in the ISO/IEC OSI reference model.”** Although this figure is not a traditional “flowchart” (with decision diamonds or arrows depicting process steps), it provides a layered architectural view of how the ISO 15118 standards align with the classic ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. In the sections below, each labeled entity is identified, and its role and connections are described in detail.

## 2. Overall Structure of the Diagram

The figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):

1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑3 standard.  
2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** – Indicated by the “V2G standardized service primitive interface,” which bridges ISO 15118‑3 with the higher-layer protocols.  
3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑2 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO 15118‑1 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  

Within the big outer box labeled “Vehicle-to-Grid communication,” two standards are highlighted:
- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)
- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)

At the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.

---

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description

### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 1 Physical.”  
- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium—e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).

### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 2 Data link.”  
- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable “low-layer” communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 appear inside the “ISO 15118‑3” box. They are the core focus of “Part 3” of the ISO 15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized “pipe” for higher-layer messages.

### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface
- **Name in Diagram**: “V2G standardized service primitive interface.”  
- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO 15118‑2 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO 15118‑3.  
- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main “handshake” region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.

### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 3 Network.”  
- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).

### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 4 Transport.”  
- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO 15118‑2**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.

### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 5 Session.”  
- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO 15118‑2** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).

### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 6 Presentation.”  
- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer—handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.

### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 7 Application.”  
- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.

### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)
- **Name in Diagram**: “Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”  
- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of “V2G” communication from an OSI perspective—covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:
  1. **ISO 15118‑1** (General information and use-case definition)  
  2. **ISO 15118‑2** (Network and application protocol requirements)

  Where **ISO 15118‑1** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118‑2** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.

### 3.10 ISO 15118‑1
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑1.”  
- **Caption**: “General information and use-case definition.”  
- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (‑2 and ‑3).

### 3.11 ISO 15118‑2
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑2.”  
- **Caption**: “Network and application protocol requirements.”  
- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118‑1 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.

### 3.12 ISO 15118‑3
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑3.”  
- **Caption**: “Physical layer and Data link layer requirements.”  
- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118‑2) can function as intended.

## 4. Relationship and Connections

1. **ISO 15118‑3 → V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  
   - ISO 15118‑3 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.

2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface → ISO 15118‑2**  
   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO 15118‑2 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.

3. **ISO 15118‑2 → OSI Layers 3–7**  
   - ISO 15118‑2 “lives” across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.

4. **ISO 15118‑1 → Overall**  
   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO 15118‑1 supplies the conceptual building blocks—e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions—that shape the services needed in layers 1–7.

5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  
   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO 15118‑1 and ISO 15118‑2 is conceptually the V2G communication “stack,” reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO 15118‑3.

---

## 5. How the Diagram “Flows”
While not a classic procedural “flowchart,” the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:

1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  
2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  
3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  
4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3–7)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  

Each standard (ISO 15118‑1, ISO 15118‑2, and ISO 15118‑3) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers

- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO 15118‑3) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO 15118‑2), with ISO 15118‑1 providing conceptual underpinnings.  
- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  
- **Interoperability**: Each layer’s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor—covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.

---

**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO 15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.


TEXTUAL INFORMATION:
Text 1: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The validation of matching decision is a method to validate the SLAC based matching by means of the control pilot line. In case the EV is not able to come to a distinct matching decision on base of the signal strength measurement, it may decide to do an additional validation process. The validation process is divided in two parts consisting of a CM_VALIDATE.REQ and CM_VALIDATE.CNF each. It is important to consider that the first and second request-response differ in the contents of the messages. In the following messages related to the first/second request-response are designated with “step 1” or “step 2”, respectively.
Text 2: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The second part of the validation process covers the control pilot toggle sequence on EV side and the counting of control pilot toggles on the EVSE side. The EV starts this process by sending the step 2 indicating “ready”. With receiving the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ, the EVSE starts counting the BCB- toggles for a time window given by the timer field of the request. As soon as the timer expires, the EVSE sends a step 2 CM_VALIDATE.CNF to the EV containing the number of BCB-Toggles seen and the result field filled with “Success”. The field is filled with “failure” whenever the validation could not be performed or the number of seen BCB-Toggles does not contain valid data.
Text 3: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way.
Text 4: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS.
Text 5: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP.
Text 6: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - The signal strength measurement method to be used is the SLAC defined in the [HPGP].
Text 7: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the result of the SLAC process, the low-layer communciation module on the EV side shall send its decision using the following relevant message after the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message:
Text 8: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the corresponding EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.4;
Text 9: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND, the low-layer communciation module shall inform the most probable EVSE by continuing the message flow as described in A.7.3;
Text 10: A.9.2.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.2.1 Functional description > A.9.2 Signal strength measurement > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - — if EV_Discovering_Status = EVSE_NOT_FOUND, the matching process shall be considered as FAILED.
Text 11: A.9.3.3.3 EVSE side (Context: A.9.3.3.3 EVSE side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EVSE receives another CM_VALIDATE.REQ with a timer field equal to zero after sending out the step 1 CM_VALIDATE.CNF, the step 1 CM_VALIDATE.CNF shall be resent.
Text 12: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - According to the EVSE Implementation, the EVSE can decide to answer to a CM_VALIDATE.REQ with the result field of CM_VALIDATE.CNF filled to “Failure”, if it does not have implemented the validation process feature. In this case, the EV shall decide
Text 13: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - either to skip the validation process and continue the matching process with SLAC_MATCH.REQ message,
Text 14: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - either to continue the validation process with the next available EVSE, which was “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”
Text 15: A.9.3.1 Functional description (Context: A.9.3.1 Functional description > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - either to terminate the session if there is no other available EVSE with “EVSE_ POTENTIALLY_FOUND”
Text 16: A.9.3.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.3.3.2 EV side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the EV does not receive any valid CM_VALIDATE.CNF for all retries, the EV shall stop the validation process with the current EVSE and continue the validation pro- cess with the next potential EVSE.
Text 17: A.9.3.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.3.3.2 EV side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If any received CM_VALIDATE.CNF contains invalid content, it shall be ignored. Content which deviates from the MME definition in Table A.5 and Table A.6 is inva- lid.
Text 18: A.9.3.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.3.3.2 EV side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the result field of the step 1 CM_VALIDATE.CNF contains “Success”, the EV shall stop the validation process with the current EVSE and continue the validation pro- cess with the next potential EVSE.
Text 19: A.9.3.3.2 EV side (Context: A.9.3.3.2 EV side > A.9.3 Validation of matching decision > A.9 Matching EV – EVSE process) - If the result field of the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.CNF contains “failure”, “not ready”, or “not required”, the EV shall stop the validation process with the current EVSE and continue the validation process with the next potential EVSE.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Related Information 1: The validation process is an asynchronous process, which means that an unmatched EVSE answers to a CM_VALIDATE.REQ in any case even with no signal strength measurement immediately before. This behaviour is necessary because the time between the signal strength measurement and the validation for a specific EVSE is not predictable due to an unknown number of validation processes with other EVSEs before. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 2: To request a validation process, the EV sends a first CM_VALIDATE.REQ to the EVSE, which contains a timer value of zero and a result field indicating “ready”. The EVSE responds with a first CM_VALIDATE. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 3: CNF, which contains a ToggleNum of zero. The result field of the message is filled in consistence with the current state of the EVSE: (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 4: — When the EVSE is ready to perform the validation process, it fills the result field with “ready”. In this case, the EV will continue with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 5: — When the EVSE is busy and not able to perform a validation, it fills the result field with “not ready”. In this case, the EVSE is not ready for the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ. The EV may start a retry by resending the first CM_VALIDATE.REQ again. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 6: — When the EVSE wants to indicate that a validation is not required, it fills the result field with “not required”. In this case, the EV may follow this advice and stop the validation process or continue the process with sending the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ to force the EVSE to follow the validation process. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 7: — In any special case where the EVSE is not able to perform any validation process or it does not have implemented the validation process feature, it fills the result field with “failure”. (sibling of Text 1)
Related Information 8: The second part of the validation process covers the control pilot toggle sequence on EV side and the counting of control pilot toggles on the EVSE side. The EV starts this process by sending the step 2 indicating “ready”. With receiving the step 2 CM_VALIDATE.REQ, the EVSE starts counting the BCB- toggles for a time window given by the timer field of the request. As soon as the timer expires, the EVSE sends a step 2 CM_VALIDATE.CNF to the EV containing the number of BCB-Toggles seen and the result field filled with “Success”. The field is filled with “failure” whenever the validation could not be performed or the number of seen BCB-Toggles does not contain valid data. (sibling of Text 1)

# Detailed Description of Figure 10 — EV Point of View (Matching Process)

Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the flowchart. The diagram illustrates how an Electric Vehicle (EV) determines the correct Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) connection (i.e., “matching”) based on discovery, signal strength measurements, possible validation, and ultimately setting up or failing to set up a data link.

---

## 1. List of Key Entities in the Figure

1. **Entering matching process**  
   - Represents the beginning of the procedure once the EV is ready to identify which EVSE it is physically connected to.

2. **Discovery of the connected communication nodes**  
   - The EV discovers all communication nodes (EVSEs) detected on the physical link.

3. **Signal strength measurement**  
   - The EV measures signal strength metrics from all discovered communication nodes.  
   - “Signal Strength Measurement is a value range indication within the matching process.”

4. **Signal strength analysis**  
   - The EV analyzes the measured signal strength to determine how strongly the EVSE’s signals are received.

5. **Low signal attenuation**  
   - Indicates a strong signal measurement.  
   - If the analysis confirms a single strong connection, the result can be “EVSE_FOUND.”

6. **Ambiguous result (multiple EVSE’s, uncertain signal strength)**  
   - The EV sees more than one possible candidate or uncertain measurement.  
   - Proceeds with the interim status “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND.”

7. **High signal attenuation**  
   - Indicates a weak signal.  
   - If the analysis indicates no suitable EVSE, the result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”

8. **Result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   - The outcome that the EV confirms exactly one matching EVSE based on the signal measurement.

9. **Result is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”**  
   - The outcome that the EV sees a possible match but cannot fully confirm. A validation step might be needed.

10. **Result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
    - The outcome that the EV determines no valid EVSE is connected.

11. **Declared result is “EVSE_FOUND” / “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” / “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
    - Refers to the EV deciding or declaring the final outcome after possibly applying use-case-based rules.  
    - For “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND,” the EV may treat that result as either “EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND,” depending on scenario.

12. **optional**  
    - Indicates that certain paths (e.g., additional validation) might be skipped according to the configuration or use-case definition.

13. **Validation of matching decision**  
    - An optional or necessary process (depending on the result and the system requirements) to confirm physically that the EV is indeed connected to the intended EVSE.  
    - Can involve “BCB-Toggle” sequences on the control pilot line if the discovery result was ambiguous.

14. **Validation result? (found / not found)**  
    - After attempting validation, the EV either confirms or rejects the EVSE.  
    - If confirmed → proceed to network setup.  
    - If rejected → proceed to “next EVSE” or declare no link.

15. **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  
    - If more than one EVSE was discovered and not yet validated, the EV can continue validating in sequence.

16. **next EVSE**  
    - The EV moves to another candidate EVSE and repeats the validation step.

17. **Setup logical network**  
    - If the EV is satisfied with the discovered/validated EVSE, it sets up the logical (data link) communication network with that EVSE.

18. **Data link established?**  
    - Checks whether the EV has successfully established the data link (i.e., the communication session and all necessary transport layers).

19. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)**  
    - Indicates to higher-layer entities (HLE) that a data link is set up (matching is successful).  
    - From here, upper layers continue the binding process outlined in ISO 15118-3.

20. **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)**  
    - Indicates that no valid data link is available (matching has failed).  
    - The process can exit, and higher layers are notified that no link was established.

21. **Exit matching process with success / failure**  
    - Final outcome: the EV is either matched or not matched to an EVSE.

22. **NOTE**  
    - “Error handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.”  

---

## 2. Flow of the Diagram (Step by Step)

1. **Entering matching process**  
   The EV transitions into the matching phase (often triggered by a control pilot transition to an active charging state).

2. **Discovery of the connected communication nodes**  
   - The EV enumerates all communication nodes visible on the physical link.  
   - Multiple EVSEs may be detected (e.g., in scenarios with cross-talk).

3. **Signal strength measurement**  
   - The EV measures how strongly each communication node’s signal is received.

4. **Signal strength analysis**  
   - The EV compares measured signals. Three possible outcomes:  
     a) **Low signal attenuation** → strong signal from one node.  
     b) **Ambiguous result** → multiple nodes with uncertain or similarly strong signals.  
     c) **High signal attenuation** → no suitable (or extremely weak) signals.

5. **Branching into three results**  
   - If **low signal attenuation** is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_FOUND.”**  
   - If **ambiguous** measurement is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND.”**  
   - If **high signal attenuation** is observed:  
     → The EV sets **Result = “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”**

6. **Result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   - Optionally, the EV may do a sanity/validation check (depending on the scenario).  
   - Otherwise, it can declare final result as “EVSE_FOUND” and proceed.

   **Declared result is “EVSE_FOUND”**  
   → Next step: **Setup logical network**.

7. **Result is “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”**  
   - The EV might treat it as “EVSE_FOUND” or “EVSE_NOT_FOUND,” or it can continue with an actual **Validation of matching decision**.  
   - If it decides not to validate further (per system rules), it may directly set “Declared result is ‘EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND’” and treat it accordingly.  
   - Otherwise, proceed to the next diamond: **Validation of matching decision**.

8. **Result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND”**  
   - If the EV cannot identify a valid EVSE, or the signal is too weak to be recognized, the EV declares “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”  
   - **Declared result is “EVSE_NOT_FOUND.”**  
   - This immediately leads to the EV calling **D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** and exiting the process (with failure).

9. **Validation of matching decision** (found on the “EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND” path or optionally on the “EVSE_FOUND” path)  
   - The EV requests (and performs) additional confirmation with the EVSE (for instance, using the control pilot “BCB-Toggle” procedure mentioned in Clause 9.4).  
   - **Validation result?**  
     1. **found**: The EV confirms the EVSE is correct. Proceed to “Setup logical network.”  
     2. **not found**: The EV rejects this EVSE, checks if there is a **Remaining unvalidated EVSE?**  
        - If **yes**, go to **next EVSE** and repeat.  
        - If **no**, proceed to “Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)” (failure).

10. **Setup logical network**  
    - Once certain of the correct EVSE, the EV sets up the low-level communication (logical network).  
    - **Data link established?**  
      - If **yes** → **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)** → exit with success.  
      - If **no** → **Call D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)** → exit with failure.

11. **Exit matching process**  
    - Either as a success (the EV is matched and ready for higher-layer communication) or as a failure (no valid link or incorrect EVSE discovered).

12. **NOTE**  
    - “Error handling for Matching Process is not shown in this figure. See A.9.8.” The figure omits certain fallback or error paths (e.g., hardware faults) that are described in Annex A.9.8 in the standard.

## 3. Relation and Connection Among Entities

1. **EV** – The primary actor performing discovery, measurement, and analysis.  
2. **Communication Nodes** (EVSEs) – Possible candidates that the EV might be physically attached to.  
3. **Signal Strength Measurement** – Core step for determining whether the EV has a strong enough link to confirm “EVSE_FOUND,” or if there is ambiguity (“EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”), or if no match can be made (“EVSE_NOT_FOUND”).  
4. **Validation Process** – A separate (optional or required) mechanism that uses control pilot line toggles to double-check the physical wiring.  
5. **Logical Network Setup** – The bridging or data-layer step established once the EV confidently decides on an EVSE.  
6. **D-LINK_READY.ind** – The primitive called to indicate either a successful link or a failed link to the higher layers.

---

## 4. Additional Notes from ISO 15118-3

- **Under ambiguous conditions** (“EVSE_POTENTIALLY_FOUND”), an EV may ask the EVSE to confirm the connection via a separate pilot-line validation.  
- **Error handling** is largely omitted in Figure 10; full details appear in Annex A.9.8.  
- **Any transition**—whether success or failure—results in calling D-LINK_READY.IND to notify higher layers.  
- **According to Annex 9.5**, once the logical network is successfully set up, the status changes to “Matched” and upper-layer protocols (e.g., TLS, V2G messages) can begin binding.

### Conclusion

Figure 10 (EV point of view) outlines how the EV:  
1) **Discovers** possible EVSE nodes,  
2) **Measures** and **analyzes** each node’s signal strength,  
3) **Determines** whether a single, multiple, or zero EVSEs are valid matches,  
4) **Optionally validates** ambiguous results,  
5) **Sets up** a logical network with the matched EVSE, and  
6) **Exits** by either calling “D-LINK_READY.IND (Link established)” for success or “D-LINK_READY.IND (No link)” for failure.

This step-by-step process ensures the EV consistently identifies the correct EVSE in multi-charger environments and starts a reliable higher-level communication session for the charging process.

Related Information 19: The validation of matching decision is a method to validate the SLAC based matching by means of the control pilot line. In case the EV is not able to come to a distinct matching decision on base of the signal strength measurement, it may decide to do an additional validation process. The validation process is divided in two parts consisting of a CM_VALIDATE.REQ and CM_VALIDATE.CNF each. It is important to consider that the first and second request-response differ in the contents of the messages. In the following messages related to the first/second request-response are designated with “step 1” or “step 2”, respectively. (sibling of Text 2)
Related Information 20: After the parameter exchange, the EV starts the signal strength measurement process by sending C_EV_ start_atten_char_inds times the message CM_START_ATTEN_CHAR.IND followed by C_EV_match_MNBC number of M-SOUNDS. Based on these M-SOUNDS, all potential EVSEs calculate the signal strength and send back the measurement result by means of the CM_ATTEN_CHAR.IND message. Each CM_ATTEN_ CHAR.IND is confirmed by the EV by an individual CM_ATTEN_CHAR.RSP. (sibling of Text 3)

Related Information 33: By means of the signal strength measurement, the EV has to determine which counterpart EVSE nodes are available and which one is the right one to connect to. Therefore, the EVSE measures the attenuation of the signal coming from the EV for different groups of frequencies and reports the signal strength back to the EV. Based on the reports, the EV determines the EVSE which is connected in a direct way. (sibling of Text 4)
