# Detailed Description of Figure 2 — [ISO-3] Relationship to the ISO/IEC OSI Reference Model

This figure shows how the Physical and Data Link layers used in ISO 15118‑3 (specifically for Power Line Communication on electric vehicles) align with the classic ISO/IEC 7498-1 (OSI) reference model. It illustrates the layered network architecture, culminating in interfaces that connect to higher-level protocols (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network) and basic signaling (Control Pilot) as specified in IEC 61851‑1.

Below is a step-by-step, layer-by-layer description of each entity in the figure and how they relate to each other.

---

## 1. Entities Overview

From **bottom** to **top**, the following entities appear in the diagram:

1. **Communication media**  
   The physical medium (the cable assembly) through which signals and energy are exchanged between the Electric Vehicle (EV) and the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).

2. **Signal coupling**  
   This represents the method of coupling the PLC (Power Line Communication) signal onto the AC or DC charging cable. It ensures the high-frequency PLC signal is injected or extracted without interfering with the power transfer itself.

3. **PLC Physical layer**  
   The physical layer of the Power Line Communication (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY). It defines the electrical and modulation specifications required to transmit bits over the communication media.

4. **MAC/PHY SAP**  
   The Service Access Point between the PHY (Physical) and MAC (Medium Access Control) layers. It represents the interface through which the upper layer (MAC) exchanges data and control information with the physical layer.

5. **PLC MAC layer**  
   The Medium Access Control layer that handles packet framing, addressing, and channel-access mechanisms specific to PLC (e.g., carrier-sense multiple access, collision avoidance, etc.).

6. **Convergence MAC SAP**  
   The interface between the PLC MAC layer and the convergence layer. It ensures that data from higher-layer protocols is properly formatted for MAC-layer transmission and vice versa.

7. **Convergence layer**  
   A bridging layer that adapts the classic OSI Data Link–level services (like Ethernet bridging or VLAN tagging) into the specific requirements/format of the PLC protocols. It converges or translates data to align with HomePlug GreenPHY or other PLC standards.

8. **Control SAP**  
   A specialized Service Access Point providing a control interface for the PLC or other network-management functions (e.g., encryption key management, SLAC services, link status queries). This is used by upper software modules that need direct PLC-related control/configuration.

9. **Data link control SAP**  
   An interface that provides link-status information, error management, and other data link control functionalities. This SAP ties the connection coordination module to the lower-level Data Link functionalities.

10. **Connection coordination**  
   A functional block that coordinates establishing or tearing down logical connections. It helps with matching EVs to EVSEs, exchanging handshake signals, and managing the relationship between basic IEC 61851-1 signaling and the higher, logical data connections of ISO 15118.

11. **Data SAP**  
   The interface between the Data Link layer and the Network (layer 3) or higher layers for actual V2G (vehicle-to-grid) data exchange. All high-level charging messages (e.g., those required by ISO 15118-2) flow through the Data SAP.

12. **Higher layers**  
   In OSI terms, these encapsulate the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, and Network layers. ISO 15118-2 typically operates at these layers (exchanging XML messages, session management, security, etc.).

13. **Control pilot (IEC 61851-1) Hardware I/Os**  
   Shown to the right, this denotes the separate hardware line(s) used for “basic signaling” (PWM duty cycle, pilot states, etc.). It is not strictly part of the PLC communication stack but interplays with it (for example, telling the EV and EVSE when to begin or end coupling for high-level communication).

14. **OSI reference model layers**  
   A vertical bracket on the left reminding us that Physical and Data Link layers in the OSI model are here implemented by the PLC layers and the “convergence layer.”

15. **Key**: “covered by communication technology specification”  
   The figure highlights (in gray) the parts (Convergence layer, PLC MAC, PLC PHY, etc.) that are defined by specific communication technology standards (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY, IEEE 1901 Profile GreenPHY).

---

## 2. Detailed Layer-by-Layer Explanation and “Flow”

Although this is not a conventional “flowchart,” the diagram can be read from the **Physical** layer at the bottom to the **Application** layer at the top to understand how data flows and which components interact:

1. **Communication Media (Bottom Layer)**  
   • Power cabling used for vehicle charging is also used to carry data signals.  
   • Power is transferred from the EVSE to the EV; meanwhile, high-frequency signals are superimposed for data exchange.

2. **Signal Coupling Layer**  
   • Couples the PLC signal on top of the AC or DC power line.  
   • Ensures minimal interference and correct impedance matching to pass data effectively between EV and EVSE.

3. **PLC Physical Layer**  
   • Responsible for modulating and demodulating waveforms on the power line.  
   • Follows standards such as HomePlug GreenPHY for robust physical signaling (e.g., OFDM, error correction).

4. **MAC/PHY SAP**  
   • Logical interface that the MAC layer uses to send and receive frames (bits, symbols) via the Physical layer.  
   • Transmits or receives packets after being encoded/decoded at the PHY.

5. **PLC MAC Layer**  
   • Implements media access rules (channel sensing, collision avoidance, etc.).  
   • Adds header/trailer fields managing addressing and error detection.  
   • Manages bridging to upper or lower layers via convergence sub-layers.

6. **Convergence MAC SAP**  
   • Provides a standardized interface for the next layer (Convergence layer) to get data from MAC frames.  
   • Ensures correct framing and token passing between the Convergence and MAC layers.

7. **Convergence Layer**  
   • Adapts the PLC MAC frames into a more generic data link structure or vice versa.  
   • Potentially includes bridging or VLAN tagging for IP-based or ISO 15118-2 application data.  
   • At this layer, the system transitions from technology-specific data link frames to a more general data link service usable by higher protocols.

8. **Control SAP**  
   • A specialized side-interface that configuration/control processes (like encryption-key management or the SLAC process used for EV–EVSE association) can call.  
   • Enables reading/writing certain parameters in the PLC MAC or PHY, including link status, encryption keys, and networking specifics.

9. **Data Link Control SAP**  
   • Presents data link status (connected, disconnected, error) and handles command signals for enabling or disabling link functionalities.  
   • Ties in to the Connection Coordination function, letting higher-layer logic know about link conditions.

10. **Connection Coordination**  
    • Supervises or orchestrates which link or channel is used, how the handshake or matching occurs, and whether the EV and EVSE are “paired.”  
    • Tightly integrated with basic signaling from IEC 61851-1 (Control Pilot) and high-level communication from ISO 15118-2.

11. **Data SAP**  
    • The normal “data” interface for exchanging V2G protocol payloads (e.g., charging session requests, contract identification) between the Data Link layer and the higher OSI layers (Network and above).  
    • Actual ISO 15118-2 messages pass through this Data SAP after being encapsulated into MAC frames.

12. **Higher Layers**  
    • Spanning OSI Layers 3 to 7 (Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).  
    • In the context of ISO 15118, these higher layers format, encrypt, and interpret the actual “plug-and-charge” or “vehicle-to-grid” messages.

13. **Control Pilot (IEC 61851-1) Hardware I/Os**  
    • Shown on the right side as a separate domain.  
    • Provides basic PWM signaling to indicate EV states, EVSE states, maximum current capability, presence of the EV, or charging fault conditions.  
    • Ties into overall Connection Coordination to start or stop the PLC communication as required by the standard.

## 3. Relationship and Connection of Entities

- **Physical to MAC**  
  Data moves from the **Communication media** (power lines) through **Signal coupling** into the **PLC Physical layer**, which transmits/receives bits. The **MAC/PHY SAP** is then used to pass frames to/from the **PLC MAC layer**.

- **MAC to Convergence**  
  The **PLC MAC layer** sends or receives data frames to the **Convergence layer** through the **Convergence MAC SAP**. At this stage, commands and bridging logic are aligned with the needs of higher-level protocols.

- **Convergence to Higher Protocols**  
  After the Convergence layer, there are multiple SAPs:
  1. **Control SAP** for direct PLC control and configuration queries (e.g., security keys, link info).  
  2. **Data Link Control SAP** for controlling the link status, error notifications, and link enable/disable.  
  3. **Data SAP** for normal data traffic that flows up to the OSI Network or Transport layers.

- **Coordination with Basic Signaling**  
  The **Connection coordination** block leverages the **Control SAP** and **Data link control SAP** to manage the handshake between the EV and EVSE at both the PLC level and the basic PWM signaling level. Meanwhile, the **Control pilot** line (IEC 61851-1) physically coordinates the presence detection and permissible current via the duty cycle.

- **Higher Layers**  
  Above the **Data SAP**, normal IP networking (or the ISO 15118-2 application messages) can proceed. These higher-layer protocols rely on the data path established at lower layers by the PLC system and are orchestrated by the **Connection coordination** function.

---

## 4. Key Takeaways

1. **Layered Architecture**  
   The figure highlights how the Physical and Data Link layers of ISO 15118‑3 map directly onto the OSI reference model. The “convergence layer” ensures that higher layers can remain mostly independent of the underlying PLC technology.

2. **Control vs. Data**  
   Two main SAP families exist:  
   - **Control SAP / Data Link Control SAP**: For link management, error reporting, and secure network configuration.  
   - **Data SAP**: For passing normal application data (ISO 15118-2 messages) to the upper layers.

3. **Basic Signaling Integration**  
   IEC 61851-1’s control pilot is shown outside the PLC stack, yet it is integral to “Connection coordination,” ensuring correct startup, safety interlocks, and fallback charging states.

4. **Covered by Communication Technology Specification**  
   The gray regions (Convergence layer, MAC, PHY) are implementations guided by specific PLC standards (e.g., HomePlug GreenPHY). They are thus “covered by communication technology specification.”

By understanding each block and interface, engineers can quickly trace how signals and data flow from the power line (physical) up to the ISO 15118 application protocol, and how the system coordinates the link state with basic pilot signaling.

## 2. Overall Structure of the Diagram

The figure is conceptually divided into three major sections (from bottom to top):

1. **Lower Layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑3 standard.  
2. **Intermediate Layer Boundary** – Indicated by the “V2G standardized service primitive interface,” which bridges ISO 15118‑3 with the higher-layer protocols.  
3. **Higher Layers (OSI Layers 3 through 7)** – Represented by the ISO 15118‑2 standard for network and application-level communication, with references to ISO 15118‑1 for general concepts and use-case definitions.  

Within the big outer box labeled “Vehicle-to-Grid communication,” two standards are highlighted:
- **ISO 15118-1** (covering general info and use-case definitions)
- **ISO 15118-2** (covering network and application protocol requirements)

At the bottom, a second large box is labeled **ISO 15118-3** (covering physical and data link layer requirements). Between these two boxes, a horizontal band is labeled **V2G standardized service primitive interface**, indicating the interface boundary where higher-level protocols interact with physical and data link services.

---

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Description

### 3.1 OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 1 Physical.”  
- **Role**: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium—e.g., the actual cable or wireless medium used for communications.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** covers the physical layer requirements, ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (EVSEs) are interoperable at the physical signal level (e.g., Power Line Communication (PLC), electromagnetic compatibility requirements, etc.).

### 3.2 OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 2 Data link.”  
- **Role**: The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected nodes, handling error detection/correction and basic framing.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑3** also covers the data link layer requirements (e.g., MAC addressing, PLC MAC layer specifics) to ensure a stable “low-layer” communication for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 appear inside the “ISO 15118‑3” box. They are the core focus of “Part 3” of the ISO 15118 series, which defines how signals and data frames are sent over the physical medium and how they link up into a standardized “pipe” for higher-layer messages.

### 3.3 V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface
- **Name in Diagram**: “V2G standardized service primitive interface.”  
- **Role**: This horizontal band sits between the physical/data link layers (bottom) and the upper layers (top). It serves as a boundary or interface that allows the protocols described in ISO 15118‑2 (network and application) to communicate with the lower-layer technology specified by ISO 15118‑3.  
- **Importance**: It defines how services and primitives (e.g., data requests, acknowledgements, connection management) are exchanged between the data link layer and higher network/application layers. This is the main “handshake” region that ensures a consistent interface across potentially different hardware or firmware implementations.

### 3.4 OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 3 Network.”  
- **Role**: The network layer handles packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. In the scope of V2G, it organizes data exchange at the IP layer (or other possible network-layer protocols).  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** is responsible for specifying how the network layer is used for V2G communication (e.g., IP addressing, transport selection requirements).

### 3.5 OSI Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 4 Transport.”  
- **Role**: Responsible for reliable or unreliable end-to-end transport of data (e.g., TCP/UDP). In V2G contexts, this layer ensures robust message delivery or streaming.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Again, covered by **ISO 15118‑2**, which dictates how the transport layer interacts with the network layer and the session layer to support the V2G protocols.

### 3.6 OSI Layer 5 (Session)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 5 Session.”  
- **Role**: Helps manage and control the connections between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.  
- **Referenced Standard**: Part of the **ISO 15118‑2** coverage, ensuring session-oriented capabilities (like initiating a charging session, exchanging messages for contract authorization, etc.).

### 3.7 OSI Layer 6 (Presentation)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 6 Presentation.”  
- **Role**: Ensures that data is in a usable format for the application layer—handling data encryption, serialization, and translation if necessary.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2** also governs how data representation and encoding details (e.g., XML, EXI) are handled in the V2G messages.

### 3.8 OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- **Name in Diagram**: “OSI layer 7 Application.”  
- **Role**: Closest to the end-user; in V2G, it describes the application-level data exchanges that facilitate use-cases like contractual identification, pricing, charging profiles, and energy management.  
- **Referenced Standard**: **ISO 15118‑2**. All relevant V2G messages (e.g., request/response for charging schedules, authentication, or payment) are part of the application layer protocols described here.

### 3.9 Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Top-Level Box)
- **Name in Diagram**: “Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”  
- **Role**: This large box depicts the entire scope of “V2G” communication from an OSI perspective—covering from network to application aspects. It conceptually contains two key parts:
  1. **ISO 15118‑1** (General information and use-case definition)  
  2. **ISO 15118‑2** (Network and application protocol requirements)

  Where **ISO 15118‑1** sits within the conceptual top-level because it outlines overarching use-cases and contexts, while **ISO 15118‑2** addresses the technical details of how to implement them in the network/application layers.

### 3.10 ISO 15118‑1
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑1.”  
- **Caption**: “General information and use-case definition.”  
- **Role**: Provides the foundational concepts, goals, and use-case scenarios for V2G. It does not specify OSI layers per se but offers the background and scope for the more technical parts (‑2 and ‑3).

### 3.11 ISO 15118‑2
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑2.”  
- **Caption**: “Network and application protocol requirements.”  
- **Role**: Defines how the EV and EVSE communicate over the network and at the application layer to fulfill the use-cases that ISO 15118‑1 describes. It covers OSI layers 3 through 7 and ensures interoperability in message structuring, security, authentication, plug-and-charge features, etc.

### 3.12 ISO 15118‑3
- **Name in Diagram**: “ISO 15118‑3.”  
- **Caption**: “Physical layer and Data link layer requirements.”  
- **Role**: Specifies the physical mediums, data link procedures (PLC modems, MAC sublayer specifics), and any hardware-level interoperability requirements, including timing, cable specifications, electromagnetic compatibility, etc. This standard ensures that EV and EVSE can transmit signals reliably so that higher-layer protocols (ISO 15118‑2) can function as intended.

---

## 4. Relationship and Connections

1. **ISO 15118‑3 → V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface**  
   - ISO 15118‑3 defines how data is physically encoded/decoded, then delivered to the next layer via service primitives. The horizontal interface states exactly how these data units or service requests move up to the higher layers.

2. **V2G Standardized Service Primitive Interface → ISO 15118‑2**  
   - The standardized interface allows protocols defined in ISO 15118‑2 to operate independently of the underlying physical or data link technologies. This separation provides modularity and helps different hardware implementations remain compatible as long as they abide by the same interface primitives.

3. **ISO 15118‑2 → OSI Layers 3–7**  
   - ISO 15118‑2 “lives” across the network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers, specifying how messages are constructed, routed, and validated for end-to-end V2G communication.

4. **ISO 15118‑1 → Overall**  
   - Although not explicitly mapped to a single OSI layer, ISO 15118‑1 supplies the conceptual building blocks—e.g., high-level use-cases, general requirements, and definitions—that shape the services needed in layers 1–7.

5. **Vehicle-to-Grid Communication (Overall)**  
   - Encompasses the end-to-end scenario, from the physical signals (lowest layer) to the application messages (highest layer). The entire diagonal or wave-like region that includes ISO 15118‑1 and ISO 15118‑2 is conceptually the V2G communication “stack,” reliant upon the hardware-level foundation described by ISO 15118‑3.

---

## 5. How the Diagram “Flows”
While not a classic procedural “flowchart,” the layering suggests an upward flow of data and messages:

1. **Physical/Layer 1**: Signals on the cable or PLC.  
2. **Data Link/Layer 2**: Data is framed, and local links are established error-free.  
3. **V2G Service Interface**: The boundary where well-defined primitives let higher-level protocols control or request link services.  
4. **Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application (Layers 3–7)**: Actual V2G messages, session management, security, and application data (e.g., payment, contract ID exchange).  

Each standard (ISO 15118‑1, ISO 15118‑2, and ISO 15118‑3) is responsible for a portion of this layered model. ISO 15118-1 sets the context, ISO 15118-2 handles the upper communication layers, and ISO 15118-3 ensures the physical/data link reliability.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Engineers

- **Separation of concerns**: The figure neatly distinguishes the physical/data link requirements (ISO 15118‑3) from the network-to-application requirements (ISO 15118‑2), with ISO 15118‑1 providing conceptual underpinnings.  
- **Modularity**: By adhering to the OSI layering, manufacturers can update physical or data link implementations without forcing redesign of higher-layer protocols, as long as the standardized service interface remains intact.  
- **Interoperability**: Each layer’s compliance ensures that an EV from one vendor can communicate effectively with an EVSE from another vendor—covering everything from signal waveforms to network addresses to high-level billing transactions.

---

**Figure 1** thus serves as a foundational reference for how the entire V2G communication stack (layers 1 through 7) aligns with the separate parts of the ISO 15118 standard, illustrating the scope and boundary of each part in the OSI model. The layered design promotes a robust, flexible, and interoperable charging ecosystem for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.
